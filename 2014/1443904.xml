    <AbstractNarration>Science and technology (S&amp;T) are studied and deployed in complex and uncertain environments. These environments include systems of interacting components coming from the natural world, human-created world, and socio-cultural contexts. Because of the complexity of multiple interacting elements of systems in which S&amp;T are embedded, the impacts of S&amp;T are not always predictable or even understood. Furthermore, how to govern science and technology in the best manner possible, upstream of technological deployment, is not usually obvious. Through better understanding these systems and interactions within them, policies for S&amp;T can be better designed and executed. For example, sensitive system components, feedback loops, or leverage points can be identified and targeted for policy-making or future data collection. Yet, systems research is difficult. A holistic understanding of S&amp;T policy systems requires the multi-disciplinary and diverse perspectives of, scholars, practitioners, and stakeholders to examine them from scientific and practical standpoints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) provide an international forum for the presentation and discussion of frontier research in the natural and physical sciences designed to maximize productive interaction between attendees. For over 75 years they, have been viewed as the world's premier scholarly meetings. The 2014 GRC on S&amp;T Policy: Systems Approaches to Research and Practice (August 10-15, 2014) will address the challenges and opportunities associated with systems research and practice in S&amp;T Policy. A Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will precede the 2014 GRC on S&amp;T policy and take place on Aug 9-10, 2014. The GRS creates a forum for graduate students and those starting their careers to present their work and receive mentoring by more experienced professionals in the field. This type of conference is an important component of training, as participants gain valuable leadership experience as speakers, discussion leaders, and organizers. GRS participants also attend the GRC and present posters, allowing them to interact with prominent S&amp;T policy scholars. Both the GRS and GRC, explicitly promote participation by diverse communities, including women, under-represented minorities, scholars from developing countries, and multiple sector-representatives (government, non-profits, industry, academe, think-tanks, et al). The conference will serve to increase the presence of these groups in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The conference will improve scholarship within S&amp;T policy and help to harness the knowledge to innovate in public-policy domains, matching two key goals of the NSF Science of Science Policy program. The conference will have positive downstream effects on decision-making about S&amp;T, will help to better define the field of S&amp;T policy, and will assist in setting an research agenda for important unanswered questions. The GRS/GRC is expected to increase graduate-student and young-scholar interest in the field of S&amp;T Policy (including the Science of Science Policy), and in many cases, to change the course of their careers.</AbstractNarration>
