    <AbstractNarration>The GENI community has obtained significant value from the IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) infrastructure deployed at multiple campuses. Ongoing projects using the WiMAX infrastructure include ones in public safety, the Mobility First Future Internet Architecture project, a collaboration between Wayne State University and the Ford Motor Corporation, and the Clemson Smart River project, to name a few. However, with LTE technology becoming the 4G cellular standard, there is a need to explore future wireless testbeds. This project will fund a workshop that will provide community input into planning for possible next generation wireless testbeds focused on wireless applications, and in particular concepts that are being explored in the design of this infrastructure:&lt;br/&gt; - Streamlined base station configurations that shift processing onto distributed cloud computing resources, such as GENI racks, that are co-located with base stations;&lt;br/&gt; - Ability to construct end-to-end "slices" that combine the mobile and fixed network, computation, and storage resources required to provide new and novel services; and&lt;br/&gt; - Simple, scalable wireless infrastructure, ideally covering a few city-scale areas at high density and providing direct access to the distributed cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to ensure that workshop output includes the views and needs of other US Government organizations which are currently exploring the use of LTE and commercial cellular technologies, the workshop will be held in Washington, DC. Tentative dates include either late September 2014 or early November 2014. Participants will include academics, corporate researchers, officials from agencies of the US Government such as the Department of Defense, and cellular operators.</AbstractNarration>
