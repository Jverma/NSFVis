    <AbstractNarration>Legacy and emerging applications with large working sets and, when executed on commodity servers, &lt;br/&gt;may exhibit poor performance due to frequent page faults which rely on the slow disk swap partition. &lt;br/&gt;This research aims to establish immense memory collectively across nodes of a networked computing system for holding pages &lt;br/&gt;evicted from the main memory of any participating nodes during application runs with large working sets, &lt;br/&gt;realizing cooperative memory expansion (COMEX). It has a great promise to advance technical understanding &lt;br/&gt;and scientific frontiers of networked computing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Given its wide adoption by operating systems and networking gear vendors nowadays, &lt;br/&gt;the remote direct memory access (RDMA) technology is adopted by COMEX for ultra-low latencies in page transfer &lt;br/&gt;between nodes whose OS kernel and CPU can be totally bypassed. &lt;br/&gt;This project deals with five technical challenges and the solution approaches to those challenges together &lt;br/&gt;will constitute the basis of the COMEX Handler, able to enhance execution performance and system throughput &lt;br/&gt;via better utilizing overall system DRAM memory on-demand. &lt;br/&gt;The project will also improve the research and educational activities on computer systems and distributed computing &lt;br/&gt;on the University of Louisiana at Lafayette campus, with its outcomes helping to integrate research and education for enriched teaching, &lt;br/&gt;training, and learning experience and to educate quality future workforce critical to the NSF mission, the state of Louisiana and the nation.</AbstractNarration>
