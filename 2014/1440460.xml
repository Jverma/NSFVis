    <AbstractNarration>The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), in collaboration with the National Park Service and other organizations, will organize a climate adaptation science and education workshop that will focus on engaging diverse public audiences in learning about climate adaptation. The outcomes of the workshop will include: a strong regional network to continue and sustain the initiative; a strategic plan for Sandy Hook that will result in model for using parks as laboratories for climate adaptation education; and the identification of existing climate adaptation education projects that can inform the strategic plan and the model. These outcomes will have broad relevance for the many environmental science and education projects funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, centered on Gateway National Recreation Area and surrounding New York/New Jersey communities, will engage diverse stakeholders including community members, research scientists, park staff, and others. Participants will assess and further develop research findings that reveal the potential of place-based contexts, such as parks and recreation areas, as settings for learning about global adaptation issues such as sea level rise, impacts on fish habitat due to inundation and changes in water quality, impacts on recreational fishery, and coastal resilience. Workshop findings will be disseminated broadly through the NPCA national network, national parks, and other organizations concerned with climate adaptation education.</AbstractNarration>
