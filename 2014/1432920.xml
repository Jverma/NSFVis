    <AbstractNarration>The research team has developed a point-of-care health technology that offers a new approach for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The technology uses a wireless wearable multi-sensor suite and algorithm to monitor an OSA patient's biorhythms during sleep, predict a sleep apnea event several minutes ahead of its inception and gently stimulate the muscles responsible for the obstruction when a sleep apnea episode is predicted to be imminent. Central to the technology is the suite of sensors coupled with advanced "big data" prediction methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current treatments for OSA include Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and various forms of surgery. The approach offered by this technology has the potential to be far less expensive than CPAP or surgery, and is less invasive. This technology would provide at-home monitoring and treatment of OSA and would benefit the biomedical solution providers who are interested in providing cost-savings and at-home monitoring and treatment.</AbstractNarration>
