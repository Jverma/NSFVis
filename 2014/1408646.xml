    <AbstractNarration>Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CDMS is currently operating at the Soudan underground laboratory in Minnesota with 10 kg of novel iZIP detectors that have already demonstrated a background rejection factor sufficient for zero background operation with several hundred kg targets. This high background rejection and control of contamination that the SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies, providing excellent sensitivity to low mass dark matter, competitive sensitivity to high-mass WIMPS, and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. The SCU team will continue to play a central role in the testing and characterization efforts at Stanford, including bringing online, maintaining, upgrading and/or operating three Stanford fridges. The PI will devote approximately 25% of her time on long-term R&amp;D that could impact a future experiment, for example in the area of code-division-multiplexing for SQUID-based readouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support research and training opportunities for students at several levels to work on an experiment that will address one of the most fundamental problems of modern science, the nature of dark matter. SCU undergraduates will complete laboratory-based work for CDMS primarily in the areas of detector fabrication, testing and optimization.</AbstractNarration>
