    <AbstractNarration>Missoula College will implement "Sustainable Energy Technology Program Enhancement at Missoula College: Partnering for Success", a program focused on recruiting, educating and graduating the next generation of energy technologists. Blackfeet Community College (BCC) is a key partner in this project. This partnership will result in engagement of Native American faculty and students in energy technician training and research opportunities. Another key partner is Missoula County Public Schools. The project will engage high school teachers in a two week summer course, following which they will mentor high school students who can earn dual credit towards their diplomas and one of the targeted programs at Missoula College. All of the activities are designed to ultimately equip high school and community college students to enter the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) technician workforce with expertise in sustainable energy alternatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's goals are to: educate the next generation of energy technologists through new course offerings and delivery systems including face-to-face classroom instruction, online classroom instruction, laboratory instruction and industry-based educational experiences; engage local high school students, lifelong learners, distance learners, rural students, and Native American college students in technical education via community events, web-based communication, and a mobile learning lab; and strengthen and create connections with local businesses, non-profits, and the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Centers. The project will be evaluated using the Context, Input, Process and Product (CIPP) model to determine the effectiveness and impact of project inputs, processes, products and context. After refining program elements based on the evaluation results, the investigators plan to greatly expand the campus boundaries of the Energy Technology Program and transform the thought patterns of students, educators, and citizens, regardless of their location, through the use of web-based material and on-site education sessions. Learning materials will also be made available to institutions nationwide through various means (e.g. online, other Advanced Technological Education projects and centers, etc.).</AbstractNarration>
