    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed workshop is to provide a forum for disseminating information and sharing ideas about the frontiers of Food Safety research, education, and technology transfer. The workshop will discuss the current state-of-the-art and future potential of Food Safety Technology, analyze the gaps between the future potential and the present reality, and identify what needs to be done in the areas of research, education, and technology transfer in order to close the gaps. This workshop will be a two-day event on October 29-30, 2014 in Alexandria, Virginia. The workshop will cover four themes: 1) Processes, 2). Global Trends, 3). Packaging, and 4). Supply Network Risk Management. Each speaker, who is an expert on the presentation topic, will introduce the state-of-the-art of a specific topic area as well as present his/her views on the future directions and needs in that area. This workshop will have up to 75 participants, including the speakers and moderators to be invited and other stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. The ideas presented by the speakers and generated from the discussion sessions will be summarized in the final project report. This report will be delivered to all workshop participants and relevant funding agencies as well as disseminated widely to industry, government, and academic stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
