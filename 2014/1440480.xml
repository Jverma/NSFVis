    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the Doctoral Consortium in Pervasive Health Care is to support the doctoral students through constructive remarks and feedback on their research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other students. Student participants will be from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform pervasive computing, including biomedical informatics, computer science, information science, engineering, clinical sciences, law, and related fields. The student participants should be well into their dissertation research and will be expected to give short presentations of their work during the Consortium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Consortium will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare in Oldenburg, Germany. PervasiveHealth is a premier international forum with specific focus on technologies and human factors related to the use of ubiquitous computing in healthcare and wellbeing. The participants will be mentored by faculty members and provide a longer term supportive mentoring network to help new researchers navigate the challenges of interdisciplinary research. The DC will take place on the weekend prior to the PervasiveHealth conference. This will allow students to also participate in the overall conference as well.</AbstractNarration>
