    <AbstractNarration>Prof. Jong-in Hahm and her students in the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University conducts research to advance understanding of the common but very complex phenomenon of protein adsorption onto polymer surfaces. The process of protein adsorption onto solid surfaces impacts essential everyday applications in food processing/packaging, health devices, diagnostic tools, and medical products. Specifically, Prof. Hahm's research team focuses on investigating the nature of protein-surface interactions at the nanoscale whose size regime is increasingly becoming crucial for the development of highly miniaturized protein detection and diagnostic devices. The multifaceted approach of this project aims to provide fundamental insights for protein-domain specific adsorption on nanoscale polymeric surfaces which, in turn, will be valuable in laying the foundation for guiding principles to create next generation protein arrays. Through this research, graduate, undergraduate, and local high school students learn the state-of-the-art techniques of optical imaging and materials characterization. Students also gain experience in conducting solid-state protein assays in a quantitative manner using newly developed polymer-based protein nanoarrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Hahm's research team elucidates both static and dynamic interaction preferences between individual proteins and polymeric domains at the single- and sub-biomolecule level. Sub-biomolecular resolution structural imaging of individual proteins is carried out by high-resolution atomic force microscopy. In addition, kinetic measurements of protein adsorption onto various size-scale polymeric surfaces are performed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. This research aims to narrow the nanoscale-macroscale gap and promote our understanding of nanoscale protein adsorption through combined experimental and theoretical approaches.</AbstractNarration>
