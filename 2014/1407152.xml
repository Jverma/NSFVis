    <AbstractNarration>A recurring theme in mathematics is that many kinds of geometric spaces can be precisely characterized by the collection of functions defined on the space. These functions can be added and multiplied, forming a structure called an algebra. These algebras of functions are defined in such a way that the product of two functions does not depend upon the order in which they are multiplied, just as in numerical multiplication. But many algebras arising in mathematics and quantum physics are noncommutative, and such algebras do not have a corresponding geometric space (in our current understanding of this term). This project has two related goals: first, to better understand a certain class of algebras that should correspond to quantum versions of ordinary "flat" (affine) spaces, and second, to seek a suitable space-like object that should form the geometric counterpart of a noncommutative algebra. The proposed approach will promote interaction between ring theory, functional analysis, and quantum physics. The PI will involve undergraduate students in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses two objectives in noncommutative algebra that are both related to foundational issues in noncommutative geometry. The first objective is to develop new techniques for the study of skew (or "twisted") Calabi-Yau algebras. These algebras simultaneously generalize two important classes of algebras from noncommutative algebraic geometry: Calabi-Yau algebras and Artin-Schelter regular algebras. Problems to be considered include invariants of actions on these algebras, the structure of these algebras in low dimensions, and duality theory for modules over such algebras. The second objective is to construct a functorial invariant for noncommutative algebras that meaningfully extends the spectrum of commutative rings and algebras. This will build upon rigorous obstructions to several natural candidates for noncommutative spectrum functors. The initial focus will be to extend the Gelfand spectrum functor from commutative to noncommutative C*-algebras.</AbstractNarration>
