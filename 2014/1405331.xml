    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The symposium entitled ?Solid Stat Chemistry of Inorganic Materials IX? will be held at the 2013 Fall Materials Research Society Symposium in Boston, MA and is partly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program within Division of Materials Research at NSF. Solid-state chemistry is an interdisciplinary field, which draws from a diverse group of scientists such as chemists, condensed-matter physicists, material scientists, electrical, chemical and mechanical engineers, ceramics, metallurgy, and mineralogy/geology. Solid-state chemistry encompasses the synthesis of new materials, preparation of materials in new forms (nanocrystalline, thin film heterostructures, porous materials, and composites), with emphasis on the relationships between composition, structure and properties, as well as the application of cutting edge characterization methods. The scope and importance of solid-state chemistry has grown not only with the discovery of new materials, but also through the advancement of techniques for preparing and studying them, and in advanced computational predictions for structures and properties. This symposium, the ninth in an established biennial series, will provide an international interdisciplinary forum for the presentation and discussion of recent advances in the solid-state chemistry of inorganic materials and their impact on commercial applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will provide a dynamic venue for scientists and engineers from all ages, including undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows, the opportunity to present there work. We have a broad cross-section of scientists with the 23 invited speakers ? five are from a national laboratory, five are junior faculty, and nine are women. There will be strong attendance and participation from North America as well as Europe and Asia. Given the interdisciplinary nature of solid-state chemistry the MRS meeting is an extremely popular venue for such a symposium.</AbstractNarration>
