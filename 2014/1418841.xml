    <AbstractNarration>The University of Southern California is awarded a grant to lead a focused planning workshop that will engage west coast marine laboratories, through the Western Association of Marine Laboratories (WAML), in developing a network around OA in coastal systems. Ocean acidification impacts in marine ecosystems are widespread, and yet they are also complex and varied at regional and local scales. Therefore, regional and local research and observational efforts are critical to reaching a greater understanding of ocean acidification (OA) impacts in coastal environments. The strategy will involve coupling long-term ecological data from diverse west coast ecosystems - kelp forests, coral reefs, estuaries, coastal waters - with corresponding ocean acidification measurement technologies based at marine laboratories, and providing data access through existing organizational frameworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With focused planning and subsequent investment in certain key technologies dedicated to understanding the marine carbonate system, WAML can serve as a nexus for implementing a valuable coastal network that links knowledge about ocean acidification to regional ecosystem dynamics. The workshop will seek to coordinate and standardize efforts across laboratories, and determine what investments are needed to significantly elevate a nascent WAML-OA alliance to an effective operational network for the benefit of the region. Ocean acidification and its associated impacts stand to influence society across many themes including climate, ecosystems, food security, coastal planning, culture and commerce. Coalescing and communicating regional OA data will empower not only research activities but also the decision-making abilities of varied stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
