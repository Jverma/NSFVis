    <AbstractNarration>Studies from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the number of software developers is expected to grow by 22% between 2012-2022, much faster than the average of all other occupations. A critical aspect of software development is the thorough testing of software, yet there is a serious lack of software testers in industry. Academic institutions contribute to this problem since few software testing courses are offered in the curriculum, and there is little, if any, software testing done in programming courses. As a result, many software companies are seeking cost effective ways to train new and existing employees on how to effectively test software using the appropriate testing techniques and testing tools. Training software testers will become more important as companies are held liable for faulty software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team proposes an online cyberlearning environment (WReSTT-Com - Web-based Repository of Software Testing Tutorials Commercial), that provides individuals and companies with the ability to obtain training in conceptual and practical skills in software testing techniques and tools. WReSTT-Com will provide trainees with an adaptive learning environment where the trainees or employers can configure the system to suit their needs, including the selection of learning objects and the generation of evaluation reports on the performance of the trainees. Income will be generated based on the time and facilities used in WReSTT-Com by trainees.</AbstractNarration>
