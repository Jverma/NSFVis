    <AbstractNarration>The Sixth Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium will take place at Yale University on October 23-26, 2014. It is the latest of a triennial sequence of meetings focusing on the aspects of analysis, geometry, and partial differential equations originally explored by Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers and leading to a robust modern theory with ramifications and connections to many other fields, including dynamics, topology, mathematical physics and number theory. The field is characterized today by an interaction between analytic methods, using the tools of classical calculus and its generalizations, combinatorial ideas in which diagrammatic patterns are built and studied, and topology in which one studies flexible spaces and their deformations. The recent solution of a number of guiding problems and the corresponding introduction of new methods promise that the conference will be vibrant and forward looking. The organizers plan to attract and support early-career mathematicians and under-represented minorities, and hope that the resulting interactions and new connections will reverberate long after the conference is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten plenary speakers will discuss recent results in dynamics of rational maps, dynamics of interval exchanges, Teichmuller theory, harmonic analysis, the structure of automorphism groups, hyperbolic geometry, probability and Schramm-Loewner evolution, and others. Parallel sessions with contributed talks will be held broadly in these areas, where the conference organizers anticipate about 50 speakers.
