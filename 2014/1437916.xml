    <AbstractNarration>1437916&lt;br/&gt;DeCarlo, Peter F.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate matter size and composition change in response to transport from the outdoor to indoor environment &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the field of air pollution, very little is known about how particle composition changes in real time when particulate matter is transported from outdoors to the indoor environment. The goal of this project is online real-time characterization of particulate chemical composition and size distribution outdoors, indoors, and in the building supply air with high time resolution (6 minute cycle of 2 minute sampling at each location). The research plan intends to fortify collaboration between outdoor air quality and an indoor air quality research. Boundary lines between these two disciplines are typically rigid, but much can be learned by two groups working in concert, as is proposed here. To facilitate this interaction, workshops will be convened on outdoor and indoor air quality, bringing together investigators in our region to define a research agenda with the goal of understanding the transformations occurring when outdoor air moves indoors. Insights gained will have the potential to improve our understanding of risk due to indoor environmental exposure to outdoor particles that are transported into the indoor environment and change in composition during that transition. Finally, public outreach opportunities are prevalent in the Philadelphia area. Events such as the Philadelphia Science Fair hosted by the Franklin Institute, offer an excellent opportunity for PI DeCarlo to showcase the results of this work to members of the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing the unique dataset, generated by instrumentation recently acquired through an NSF MRI grant (Award 1229298), this study will examine the effect of temperature and humidity gradients on dynamic partitioning behavior of particulate matter chemical composition and size distribution as it is transported from outdoors to the indoor environment. This study will ask several questions, for example: 1) How do the changes to outdoor PM size and chemical composition from typical processes (e.g. diurnal cycles, photochemical production, weather events, seasonal cycles) influence the size resolved chemical composition of indoor PM? 2) How do changes in environmental factors (gradients in temperature and humidity) influence the size resolved chemical composition of PM transported from outdoors to indoors. 3.) Are there additional chemical and physical changes to particulate matter induced in an occupied versus unoccupied room? It appears that this is the first study to use any type of Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer in the indoor environment. Aerosol mass spectrometer instruments are commonly used in atmospheric particulate measurements, but they have not yet been utilized in indoor particulate measurements and research. Pilot study investigations demonstrated the feasibility of this experimental approach and the richness of the data generated. The initial observations show the need for high time resolution and chemical information provided by aerosol mass spectrometry. The full study will make use of the real-time measurements of particulate sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon and a variety of organics species using both positive matrix factorization and ion markers for specific compounds. It is expected that the results of this study will be an important contribution, unique in the indoor air quality field.</AbstractNarration>
