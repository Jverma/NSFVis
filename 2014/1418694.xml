    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is for the National Research Council (NRC) to organize a public workshop to engage the atmospheric sciences community and others as appropriate to provide feedback on the draft by asking participants to share their views in the context of the following questions: Are the goals and objectives clear and appropriate? Are there any content areas missing from the draft that should be present if Division on Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) is to achieve its overall vision and mission? Are there adequate mechanisms for coordinating and integrating issues that involve multiple disciplines and multiple divisions within National Science Foundation? The workshop will take place on March 31-April 1, 2014 at the National Academy of Sciences, Washington DC. It will also include a brief, forward-looking session where participants will discuss research frontiers. AGS might consider pursuing in light of the goals and objectives that have been identified as well as those that have been acknowledged as missing. The committee will write a letter report reviewing the AGS draft goals and objectives by addressing the questions above from its own standpoint.</AbstractNarration>
