    <AbstractNarration>This I-Corps team has developed a wireless indoor tracking technology, and its unique properties will enable a plethora of new applications in many different areas including intelligent home automation, location based security, sports training, fine-grained indoor navigation, robotics, digital arts, education, entertainment systems, and body motion tracking for biomedical applications and film making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing local wireless tracking techniques are computing and resource intensive, provide a limited tracking speed, and require a line-of-sight (LOS) channel for achieving a reasonable spatial resolution. The wireless tracking technique proposed is unique because of its non-line-of-sight (NLOS) capability, low power requirement, and excellent spatial and temporal resolutions make it an excellent candidate for an intuitive 3D man-machine interface in different applications including home automation, security, robotics and entertainment systems. Mobile smart devices penetrated the market largely because of their intuitive and easy-to-use 2D touch-screen interface; however, the industry is badly looking for an intuitive 3D user interface solution for maximizing user experience and market expansion. The proposed technology will provide a solution for a truly natural, intuitive, and immersive 3D user interface.</AbstractNarration>
