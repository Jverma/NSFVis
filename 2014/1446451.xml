    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support to defray expenses of student participants attending the 33rd Annual Technical Conference of the National Association of Black Geoscientists (NABG), September 17-20 2014, at the Washington State University campus on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, Richland, WA. The NABG conference theme will be "Environmental Ideas for the Future", where "Environmental Ideas" might refer to the ecological environment, the economic environment, or the social environment, as well as traditional and non-traditional energy resources, all of which are undergoing unprecedented changes at this time. The primary goal of NABG is to mentor and advise students from under-represented backgrounds pursuing BS, MS, and PhD degrees in scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, providing a competent and diverse workforce fulfilling critical national needs for the 21st Century. Professional members serve as role models to participating students, and engage in a number of mentoring activities including constructive criticism of student research projects, career counseling, guidance related to professional behavior and academic advising. The meeting serves as an opportunity for academic institutions, government agencies, and the energy/environmental industry to recruit students from underrepresented groups to STEM disciplines and employment in the national geosciences workforce.</AbstractNarration>
