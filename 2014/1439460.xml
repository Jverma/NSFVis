    <AbstractNarration>The proposed service provides risk assessment for catastrophic natural disasters such as landslides, mudslides, volcanic avalanches, snow avalanche and related mass flows systems. This will help insurance and reinsurance companies improve their risk assessment by creating high-fidelity risk assessment of natural hazards, and to be more competitive on the market by using products that will incorporate innovative and recently developed methods. Such assessments are of great use to many stakeholders, planners, large risk analysis providers, government agencies (local, state, federal and international), trading. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economic costs of natural disasters in the United States have been increasing in recent decades. The proposed work can help public safety officials as well insurance companies and construction developers, by delivering risk modeling and bring predictability to the outcome of these natural disasters. Low probability events with potentially catastrophic consequences such as mudslides, landslides, snow avalanches and pyroclastic flows are among the extreme events that are the focus of the proposed service.</AbstractNarration>
