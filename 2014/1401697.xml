    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Midwest Number Theory Conference for Graduate Students and Recent PhDs (briefly, the Graduate Student Conference) hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on June 3-4, 2014. There will be one invited talk, with the remaining time being devoted to talks contributed by other participants. The Graduate Student Conference will cover number theory broadly. In the past few decades, research in number theory has experienced enormous growth, in large part from the increasingly many applications to diverse areas within, for example, physics, computer science, encryption, and security. There have been a number of spectacular recent breakthroughs, particularly on gaps between prime numbers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Graduate Student Conference continues an annual tradition of conferences, which are hosted at Midwestern universities (the Universities of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan) on a rotating schedule. Each graduate student and postdoc attending this meeting will be encouraged to present a 20-minute talk. This meeting provides a friendly and supportive atmosphere in which participants can meet and share ideas with others having an interest in number theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the Graduate Student Conference, there will be a major conference in number theory, Number Theory at Illinois, in which most attendees of the Graduate Student Conference are expected to participate. The award funds will support travel and lodging expenses for approximately 50 graduate students and postdocs to enable their participation in these conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate Student Conference web site: www.math.illinois.edu/nt2014/mntcg10.html</AbstractNarration>
