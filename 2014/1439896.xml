    <AbstractNarration>For the Nation to maintain its leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and respond to the growing diversity and needs of its school population, it is important to increase the production of STEM teachers who are well prepared to teach in high-need schools. This project, an extension of an existing Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program on the University of Texas at Dallas campus, is designed to meet that challenge. The Title I independent school districts of Dallas, Carrollton-Farmers Branch, Garland, and Richardson are partners in this project. UTeach Dallas features a compact set of professional development courses that enable a STEM major to complete the required science and mathematics education courses, student-teaching experiences, and the requirements for a STEM major in four years. The program emphasizes engaging students early and often in STEM teaching experiences. Each year the project will offer an average of ten internships to support freshman and sophomore STEM majors as they explore teaching as a profession through proffered courses and mentored teaching opportunities. Additionally, eight Noyce Scholarships will be offered - six to STEM undergraduates and two to STEM degree holders, who want to return to the university in order to become STEM teachers. The Phase II UTeach Dallas Noyce Scholarship project anticipates adding up to forty new STEM teachers to the teaching workforce over the five years of its operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UTeach Dallas partners closely with high-need school districts and student populations while working under the umbrella of the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Promising freshman and sophomore STEM majors are recruited into, and supported through, two early practicum courses in which they work with mentor teachers in local high-needs schools. Students then make a commitment to continue as Noyce Scholars with the courses and requirements needed to earn their STEM degree. Scholars also take a set of professional development courses and mentored high school teaching experiences to prepare for teaching certification. The extension of the UTeach Dallas Noyce Scholarship program into Phase II will enable enhanced project evaluation and research activities, along with strengthening identity and community among UTeach Dallas Noyce Scholars. University of Texas at Dallas faculty will also investigate and implement strategies to increase retention of UTeach Dallas students in their STEM majors. Noyce scholars are provided three years of induction and professional development opportunities once they begin teaching in local schools. Tracking of graduates will be done both internally and in partnership with the UTeach Institute which has a number of validated instruments developed for this specific purpose. The project will produce additional STEM teachers while simultaneously enabling more meaningful longitudinal studies of early Noyce graduates now teaching.</AbstractNarration>
