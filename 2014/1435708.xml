    <AbstractNarration>In this project, an investigator participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will establish the concentrations, chemical speciation, and cycling processes of arsenic and selenium in the Arctic Ocean. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The metalloid elements arsenic and selenium to be studied in this project are toxic to many marine plants and animals, and their cycling in the Arctic is not well known. Thus, this project will have important implications for increased knowledge on the chemistry of these potentially toxic elements. Results from the project will be shared through outreach to Arctic residents and through a PolarTREC teacher who will participate in the cruise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The metalloid elements arsenic and selenium have dynamic marine cycles that affect the microbiology of the water column and in turn are affected by it. Both exist in multiple oxidation states and inorganic and organic species within an oxidation state. This chemical speciation affects their reactivity and biotic uptake and toxicity. As shown in lower latitude waters, the concentration and speciation of dissolved arsenic can control the abundance and types of primary producers. In the Arctic virtually nothing is known about arsenic cycling, although there are possibly enhanced anthropogenic inputs from Canadian rivers and atmospheric deposition. In contrast, data from the high latitude North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea strongly suggest that anthropogenic selenium from coal combustion is entering the Arctic and enriching its concentration in at least one top predator. The goal of this project is to qualitatively describe the input, removal, and internal cycling processes affecting the speciation and concentrations of arsenic and selenium, and determine rates of inputs and outputs of these processes using both direct measurements and computations. The study will greatly expand knowledge about arsenic and selenium cycling, with strong implications for the changing Arctic.</AbstractNarration>
