    <AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental research to advance capabilities of the Near Field Electro-Writing process towards three-dimensional hierarchical structures with sub-micron resolution through innovation in spatial control of the jet. The working principal of this electro-writing process is based on near-field electrospinning process, in which a continuous polymer fiber is electrostatically jetted from solution or melt to a collector in close proximity. Unique to this new process, a piezo-actuated auxiliary electrode will be added near the spinneret to focus and precisely manipulate the jet; conductivity of polymer inks will be monitored; and instability analysis and fiber diameter modeling will be conducted to unlock the fundamentals of this new process. The three PIs will combine their expertise in device engineering, machine dynamics, materials chemistry and processing, mechanics, and instability analysis to analyze the fundamental process mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new process could create complex hierarchical structures with unprecedented accuracy that will benefit many applications in biomedical, micro-electronics, and energy fields. The knowledge obtained from the modeling work will add to the understanding of the physics of sub-micron fiber generation/evolution, its interaction with receiving base and its manipulation and control through external electric fields. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained through research and education activities to become the next generation work force implementing the new tools and capabilities in industry. Electrospinning techniques will be introduced to undergraduate courses as a platform to support student-driven innovations for course projects, which can be spun off to undergraduate research. Results will be disseminated to the community through publications and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
