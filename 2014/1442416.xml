    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to understand different mechanisms of integrating engineering content and standards into K-12 classrooms. The project will use a mixed methods design incorporating multiple case studies and data sources to elucidate the strategies teachers use and the obstacles they encounter in addressing engineering standards in the K-12 classroom. The project seeks to provide theoretical understanding of various methods of integrating engineering content into classrooms by working closely with teachers in custom-designed teaching laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project are to understand various ways of integrating STEM content into K-12 classrooms and thus potentially broaden the pipeline into college STEM programs and STEM careers. As more states integrate engineering into K-12 content and standards, this study which will elucidate effective means to support this integration has potentially broad impact. The projects rigorous focus on a diverse cross-section of schools may help to make the results broadly generalizable.</AbstractNarration>
