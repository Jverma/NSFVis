    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides international and domestic travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 20th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2014), which will be held in New York NY, from August 24-27, 2014. KDD is the world's premier research conference in data mining. It is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers and practitioners from all aspects of data mining, knowledge discovery, and large-scale data analytics. This year, the conference has a special theme, Data Mining for Social Good, which will highlight how the work of data analytics researchers and practitioners in contributing towards social good as well as how these high impact, social problems provide a rich set of challenges for KDD researchers. Conference proceedings are published by ACM. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, tutorials, panels, demonstrations, exhibits, and a data mining contest (KDD Cup). In 2013 the conference also included a Broadening Participation in Data Mining workshop. A strong representation of U.S. researchers, particularly students, at the conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area and also contributes to the career development of the students. This grant will partially support the travel costs for up to 20 U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the KDD conference. The award will be advertised and the results will be announced at the KDD 2014 conference website.</AbstractNarration>
