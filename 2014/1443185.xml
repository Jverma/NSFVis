    <AbstractNarration>This project funds travel support for students to attend the the 34th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2014) to be held in Madrid, Spain, June 30 - July 3, 2014. Conference experience is critical for training undergraduate and graduate students to be well-prepared for the computing workforce of the future. ICDCS is a premier conference and has a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing. The conference has made significant impacts to the computing community since it was founded in 1979. The selected papers have influenced the design and implementation of many distributed computing systems, software and applications today. Participation in such a premium conference provides an excellent opportunity for students and junior faculty members to learn the latest advances in distributed computing and interact with peers and world-renowned researchers at an international stage.</AbstractNarration>
