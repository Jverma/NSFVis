    <AbstractNarration>The American Geosciences Institute (AGI) and the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) propose to host a fall 2014 summit on implementation of standards for college and career readiness at the state level. The summit brings together key members of the Earth and Space Sciences (ESS) community to identify and devise ways in which they can work together to help states and school districts implement college and career readiness standards. A needs assessment is conducted before the summit to determine the top concerns of the stakeholders and a collaborative website is created. At the conference, a collection of standards-congruent ESS educational resources are identified and assembled. The conference report describes concrete guidelines for disseminating these resources to translate the vision and structure of the standards into teaching and learning practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2.5 day working meeting for 30 experts and stakeholders consists of short plenaries to establish the context for each set of working group sessions. The proposed plenary speakers are Steven Pruitt from Achieve, Michael Wysession, one of the lead writers of the ESS portion of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and panels of science supervisors from states that have and have not adopted the standards. In the working group sessions, conferees identify products and services that the geoscience and geoscience education community can develop to help states implement the ESS portion of the standards. A key component of the Summit is action items to move the agenda of the conference forward in the states, and commitment of the participants to follow through on the various findings of the conference is emphasized. As part of the selection process individuals will be asked for a commitment from the organizations they represent to participate in follow-up actions from the Summit. The conference and its impacts will be measured by an external evaluator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is to develop a strategy for increasing the import of teaching Earth and Space Sciences in schools to make students ready for college and careers.</AbstractNarration>
