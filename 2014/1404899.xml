    <AbstractNarration>The 2014 Barrett Lectures will be held June 16-19, 2014 at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. This year's conference, entitled "Complex Analysis in Probabilistic Settings," will focus on exciting recent developments in the intersection of these fields. Over the last two decades, there has been productive interplay between the fields of complex analysis and probability, with further connections to discrete mathematics, conformal geometry, and theoretical physics. Examples of this include Schramm-Loewner Evolution and random triangulations. The conference will feature leading researchers, Gr√©gory Miermont and Steffen Rohde, who will each give a three-talk survey lecture series. Additionally, the conference format includes invited plenary talks by senior researchers, shorter communications by early-career participants, and poster and computer demonstration sessions. This project is NSF funding to support travel and other participant costs for approximately 30 participants, especially early-career researchers and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 Barrett Lectures will be the 44th installment of a highly regarded lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H. Barrett, head of our Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969. The past conferences have attracted a distinguished series of speakers and participants. This year's conference topics highlight two notable trends in mathematics, the penetration of probabilistic methods into classical areas and the impact of computer experimentation in studying emergent phenomena. Participants will include established senior mathematicians and the early-career researchers who will push these trends. Early-career mathematicians will have the opportunity to learn from and interact with an international slate of highly regarded researchers.</AbstractNarration>
