    <AbstractNarration>This project leverages prior work on virtual mobile network technology at NICT and the MobilityFirst future Internet architecture at WINLAB, Rutgers University, to develop a comprehensive services and networking solution for high-performance cyber physical systems that scales to the "trillion object" level targeted by the JUNO program. The aim is to develop a virtual mobile cloud network (vMCN) which provides seamless and low latency services to real-time mobile users and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major research themes addressed by this project include the design of a new virtual networking framework using NICT's BYON mobile cloud technology integrated with MobilityFirst's globally unique identifier (GUID) based protocol stack; design of virtual network services for efficient support of cloud services; exploiting locality to speed up global name resolution; and dynamic migration of cloud services across networks. The project will adopt a top-down application driven methodology to validate and benchmark the performance of the proposed virtual mobile cloud network for a specific advanced CPS application. A proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed vMCN system will be developed using JGN-X and GENI testbeds in Japan and US respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technologies resulting from this project are expected to enable a wide range of commercial and government applications involving real-time cloud services for mobile devices. The project will also provide guidance for the development of future virtual network technologies of increasing interest to the networking and computer industries. The proposed collaboration will also help to strengthen research ties between US and Japan specifically in the field of future Internet architecture.</AbstractNarration>
