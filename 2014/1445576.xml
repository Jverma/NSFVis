    <AbstractNarration>A key issue in modern biology is to understand how the complex development of an organism is regulated at the molecular level. The model fruit fly system (Drosophila melanogaster) studied in Dr. Drewell's laboratory is particularly well suited to this type of research. In the last decade a number of Drosophila genomes have been completely sequenced, allowing us to begin analyzing the function and evolution of genetic regulatory regions. The experiments in this project will use a combination of molecular, genetic and computational approaches to examine the interacting network of DNA regulatory sequences at critical developmental genes, the Hox genes. As the correct pattern of expression of the Hox genes is essential for the control of cell identities in the developing embryo in all animals, the results will have very broad significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Drewell is an investigator at Harvey Mudd College (HMC). This project will build on the strong tradition of excellence in undergraduate research and education at HMC. Active engagement of undergraduates in research will be an integral part of the success of this project. Special attention will continue to be given to recruiting female, minority and first-generation college student researchers, who are currently highly represented in Dr. Drewell's laboratory. An additional major goal is to develop courses and tools for biology education by synthesizing a strong interdisciplinary curriculum in molecular and developmental biology, genetics and evolution in the Biology department at HMC.</AbstractNarration>
