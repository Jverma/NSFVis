    <AbstractNarration>The Pathways of Applied Career Experience (PACE) Science Program provides opportunities for students enrolled in the Biotechnology and Chemical Technology programs to complete internships and other applied industry experiences to supplement student learning. Partnerships with Industry Alliance Committee members are increasing student internship offerings and utilizing industry feedback to align key courses with industry needs and therefore establishing a feedback mechanism that continually improves student outcomes. Increasing internship participation rates for all students and aligning key courses with industry needs contributes highly trained entry-level employees into the local technology economy. The PACE program addresses students in need of remediation and improves the retention of all students by using Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities in selected courses. POGIL activities engage students in higher levels of thinking and collaborative group learning. It is a proven pedagogy that promotes many skills employers seek: teamwork, communication, problem solving, strong work ethic, analytical approach, taking initiative, critical thinking and time management. By implementing POGIL, technology students are more active in their learning and are better equipped with useful skills to enter the workforce. The PACE Science Program allows CCM to meet the needs of the STEM economy and the alliance with local industries demonstrates the success of the project by the number of prepared technicians produced and successfully employed.</AbstractNarration>
