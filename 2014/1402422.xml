    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Rongrong Chen of Indianapolis University examines the development of multi-functional catalysts to replace platinum (Pt) in low temperature fuel oxidation reactions. Among the various alternative systems for energy production, fuel cells are particularly attractive because they allow clean and efficient conversion of chemical energy into electricity. Currently, the most active catalysts for the oxidation of fuels such as hydrogen, methanol and ethanol in fuel cells are Pt and Pt-based materials, which are too expensive for affordable clean energy production. This research project focuses on catalysts based on cheaper materials for fuel oxidation reactions in fuel cells. By combining electrochemical measurements, in-situ spectroscopic characterization, density functional theory simulations and fuel cell testing, the collaborative team studies reaction mechanisms of hydrogen, methanol and ethanol oxidation reactions (HORs, MORs and EORs, respectively) on various catalysts in both acid and alkaline media. New multi-functional catalysts based on low cost materials (such as palladium, nickel and other more earth abundant elements) with comparable reactivities to platinum-based catalysts are designed and characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is performed in collaboration with Professor Hebe de las Mercedes in Brazil and Professor Shi-Gang Sun in China. Together, these groups combine their separate areas of expertise to examine less expensive and more sustainable fuel cell catalysts. Other broader impacts of this work include the training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students and an international exchange of ideas and expertise.</AbstractNarration>
