    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding for the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR), the locus for earth science activities at the National Research Council (NRC). BESR guides a range of projects and initiatives that provide independent, unbiased, scientific and engineering advice to the Nation on a broad spectrum of earth science issues in response to needs expressed by Congress, federal and state agencies, the science community, the private sector, and others. The proposed activities at the broadest level will encompass questions about the environment, natural hazards, energy, and natural resources and include analysis of fundamental and applied research at various scales; technology development and impacts; data provision and management (including monitoring, and geospatial data and infrastructure); and education, training, and workforce development. The proposed activities will be conducted by ad hoc committees under the Board and its five standing committees and will result in published consensus reports, short briefs, press releases, newsletters, congressional and federal agency briefings, webinars, and other products intended for public dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
