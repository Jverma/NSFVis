    <AbstractNarration>The Blue Waters system, the largest and most powerful NSF system, provides computational science and engineering teams with an effective, scalable, sustained-petascale computing platform at unmatched levels. NCSA has established a comprehensive support and outreach program by working closely with the teams that are using Blue Waters and with the larger computational science and engineering community, to enable them to take full advantage of the extraordinary capabilities of Blue Waters as well as those provided by similar systems such as Kraken, Stampede, Keeneland, Titan, and future petascale computing systems. &lt;br/&gt;This program, named NCSA/Illinois Enhanced Intellectual Services for Petascale Performance (NEIS-P2), includes a significant community outreach component aimed at enabling the general NSF computational science and engineering community to make effective use of petascale systems. The Community Engagement component includes activities to help prepare the next generation of petascale computational experts through a coordinated set of courses, workshops, fellowships and internships.&lt;br/&gt;The newly launched Blue Waters Graduate Fellows component of NEIS-P2 Community Engagement Program received more outstanding applications than can be funded with the budget available for this activity. This RAPID proposal is a request to support an additional four fellows during the 2014-2015 academic. The net result will be ten fellows supported during the first year of the Blue Waters Graduate Fellowship Program.</AbstractNarration>
