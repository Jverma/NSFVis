    <AbstractNarration>Overview: Particle physics considers a vast range of scientific questions, from subatomic to cosmic scales. These studies are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now. To meet the challenges of this quest, new theories are advanced, new detectors and accelerators are developed and built, and new computing and analytical methodologies are created, all of which have significant broader impact for the training of young scientists in the near term and the advancement of technological benefits to society over the longer term. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to introduce the science and the needed research tools for this research to university students in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This award provides partial support for US students and lecturers to attend the third "Biennial African School on Fundamental Physics and its Applications" to be held at the Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal, August 3-23, 2014. There will be four main topics at the school: 1) theoretical physics, 2) experimental sub-atomic physics, 3) accelerators and technologies and 4) analysis and grid computing. The contents will be aimed primarily at doctoral students and on students finishing their last year of university studies, but young researchers will also be encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This school will serve as an opportunity for US students and professional physicists to interact with their counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa and to form collaborations and partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
