    <AbstractNarration>Gene regulation plays a fundamental role in cellular activities and functions, such as growth, division, and responses to environmental stimuli. The regulatory interactions among genes and their expression products (RNAs and proteins) intertwine into complex and dynamic gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in cells. Recent technical breakthrough has enabled large-scale experimental studies of GRNs. A central question in GRN analysis is to elucidate network topologies and dynamics that give rise to biological properties at study. However, the magnitude and complexity of these network data pose serious challenges in extracting useful information from within. This project aims to develop statistical and computational tools to reveal underlying structure, dynamics, and functionality of GRNs. New statistical theory and inference methods will be developed to tackle theoretical and computational challenges in modeling and analyzing large-scale GRNs. Results from this research will establish a novel framework to dissect dynamical and complex biological networks, and particularly a GRN that regulates cell proliferation in our case study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional statistical analysis of GRNs typically assumes that interactions between network nodes can be described by linear functions or low-order polynomials. However, biological processes are usually complex and molecular interactions between network nodes may not be accurately described by simple functions. The main goal of this project is to develop novel and flexible statistical approaches to dissect and reconstruct GRNs by learning nonlinear interactions from time-course experimental data, with either continuous- or discrete-valued gene expression. Specifically, we will develop new modeling and analysis approaches to study GRNs using semiparametric ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and will develop state of art computational tools to characterize the structures and dynamics of GRNs, to help scientists address crucial cellular systems regulated by GRNs. The project has two parts. The first part focuses on Methods and Theory, consisting of three aims: (1) to develop new and automated statistical procedures for studying local patterns and dynamic structures in large and complex GRNs; (2) to establish valid statistical inferences on topological features and regulatory interactions of GRNs; and (3) to develop efficient computational algorithms and software for analyzing large-scale GRNs. Developed methods from this research will provide valuable tools for modeling the topologies and dynamics of GRNs using ODEs. In the second part, we will focus on real data applications. Specifically, we will apply newly developed tools in the first part to analyze a retinoblastoma (Rb)-E2F gene network, which plays a key role in controlling cell proliferation and the gene regulation within.</AbstractNarration>
