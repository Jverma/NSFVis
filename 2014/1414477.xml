    <AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology has rapidly infiltrated the technology of people's daily lives. From portable electronics, to medicine and energy; this ultra-small class of structures is having a gigantic impact. In order to realize many of the electrical, thermal and chemical properties of such structures, it is essential to investigate more complicated arrangements of nanostrucutres. Though many methods are being investigated, most are exceedingly novel, difficult to scale up, and expensive. Strategies which combine both proven technologies as well as novel engineering are ideal. This research will employ a developed nano-template technology and a new method of polymer-mediated nanoparticle synthesis to create chains of nanoparticles of specific width and length. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Kohji Ohno, an expert in polymer synthesis and surface chemistry, at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. Ultimately, this research will serve as an initial investigation that can be readily adapted to the assembly of chains possessing different and useful properties. This interdisciplinary research has the potential to serve as an inexpensive, scalable source of one dimensional nano-structures applicable in current technologies and required for emerging ones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work aims to produce long chains of covalently linked iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles via magnetic alignment in nano-channels. Surface-functionalized nanoparticles are primarily synthesized via controlled polymerization from several multi-functional initiators. Alignment is achieved by magnetically-directing the particles into aluminum oxide channels where they are photo-crosslinked and removed. Drawing from polymer, chemical and materials science disciplines; this work will be characterized by several techniques including gel permeation chromatography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Though this project is limited to iron oxide nanoparticle chains, it is generalizable to more complex systems of nanoparticles with an iron oxide core covered in a shell material (metal, semiconductor, inorganic etc.) to afford additional functionality. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
