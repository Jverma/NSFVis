    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project is intended to educate the principal investigator and the entrepreneurial lead on how to translate their drug delivery technology to the marketplace so as to enhance societal benefits. The resultant improvements to existing drug delivery will benefit those who suffer from potentially debilitating diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, cystic fibrosis, peripheral artery disease, and cancer. It is envisioned that the proposed drug delivery technology will find use in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed drug delivery technology is aimed at improving the site-specific delivery of drugs by using polysialic acid (PSA)-based nanocarriers. Conventional and newly developed therapeutics are often associated with severe consequences due to non-specific targeting and induction of immunogenic responses. In recent years, paradigms have shifted towards combining toxic drugs with molecular vehicles intended to promote delivery exclusively to the diseased region, thereby increasing efficacy and reducing side effects. It is envisioned that the proposed PSA-based nanocarrier systems, in the form of nanoparticles and micelles, will find use in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to improve the delivery of both conventional, small molecules therapeutics, as well as recently developed therapeutic biologics.</AbstractNarration>
