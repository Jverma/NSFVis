    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a variable displacement adjustable linkage pump to commercial application to fill the need for a hydraulic pump with high efficiency at low volumetric displacement. The project will result in a functional prototype of a multi-cylinder variable displacement linkage pump. This adjustable linkage pump has the following novel features: 1) it uses low friction pin joints, 2) it can reach true zero displacement, 3) the piston reaches the same top dead center position regardless of the displacement, and 4) it can pump corrosive fluids. These features improve efficiency and allow the pump to be used in a wide range of applications and environments, when compared to market leading variable displacement hydraulic pumps. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: constructing a dynamic model of the pump, constructing a framework for multi-domain multi-objective optimization of machines with mechanisms and applying the method to optimize the pump for water pumping applications, and designing and testing a multi-cylinder prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages CAT Pumps, a leader in fixed displacement linkage pump manufacturing, to aid in the design for manufacturing and prototyping process. They will give guidance on customer requirements in this technology translation effort from research discovery towards commercial reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The variable displacement linkage pump is a disruptive technology for fluid power and fluid conveyance markets by providing a broadly applicable highly efficient variable displacement pump. The energy savings from the use of the highly efficient pump directly result in a reduction in fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the pump can easily operate with water, which enables the fluid power industry to transition to environmentally friendly water hydraulics, eliminating damaging oil leaks and spills. In addition, there is a projected $15-30M in revenue over the next four years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the fluid power and fluid conveyance markets.</AbstractNarration>
