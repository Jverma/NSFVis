    <AbstractNarration>A typical web application is a complicated distributed system&lt;br/&gt;that consists of multiple components that run concurrently on multiple&lt;br/&gt;machines and interact with each other in complex ways via the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;As one would expect, developing such software systems is an error-prone&lt;br/&gt;task, and existing software development processes are not robust enough&lt;br/&gt;to produce dependable web applications. The tools developed as part of this&lt;br/&gt;project could have a broad impact by enable software developers to eliminate &lt;br/&gt;programming errors in web applications before they are deployed to end users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental building block of a web application is the data model that&lt;br/&gt;specifies the types of objects and the relations among the objects stored by&lt;br/&gt;the application, the constraints on the relations, and the actions that update &lt;br/&gt;the data by sending queries to the back-end datastore based on the user input. &lt;br/&gt;The project develops techniques that automatically extract a formal &lt;br/&gt;model from a given web application that characterizes how its data is stored&lt;br/&gt;and modified based on user actions, and infers properties about the formal data&lt;br/&gt;model. It is then possible to check the inferred properties by converting correctness &lt;br/&gt;queries about the data model to queries about satisfiability of logical formulas,&lt;br/&gt;and repair the data model to enforce the properties that are expected&lt;br/&gt;to hold.</AbstractNarration>
