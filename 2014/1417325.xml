    <AbstractNarration>The nascent Science of Security (SoS) seeks to develop the principles with which to understand how computing systems are architected, built, used, and maintained with a view to understanding and addressing security challenges systematically across their life cycle. The Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security (HotSoS), held April 2014 in Raleigh, North Carolina, will help further research in the field. HotSoS is a follow-on to the NSF/NSA-sponsored Science of Security Community meeting held in conjunction with the 2012 SaTC Principal Investigators Meeting. As this is the first year of HotSoS as a separate event, it is difficult to predict attendance, but the organizers are anticipating 150-200 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the travel grant program is to encourage participation in HotSoS by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Availability of student travel grants is publicized through the website and announcements, with particular encouragement for women and underrepresented groups to apply. Preference for awards is given to full-time students with limited other means to support their participation, with priority given to students who are presenting papers at HotSoS.</AbstractNarration>
