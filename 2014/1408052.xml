    <AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The Greater Philadelphia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, under the leadership of Drexel University, is a senior-level alliance consisting of the following public and private institutions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four-Year Institutions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drexel University&lt;br/&gt;Cheyney University&lt;br/&gt;Delaware State University&lt;br/&gt;Lincoln University&lt;br/&gt;New Jersey Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Temple University&lt;br/&gt;University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-Year Institution&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community College of Philadelphia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alliance represents a diverse alliance of public and private, two and four year, research and non-research, and minority-serving institutions. &lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;The alliance has established a firm foundation for the objectives of the 2014-2019 project activities as a &lt;br/&gt;senior-level Alliance with specific attention to: 1) further enhancing inter-institutional connectivity, 2) expanding the coordinated movement of community college students to 4-year institutions, 3) increasing the engagement of undergraduate students in national and international research experiences, as well as graduate school matriculation to continually increase retention and completion of STEM baccalaureate degrees and improve STEM student competitiveness for graduate programs in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will include enhancing partnerships, research collaborations, and articulation strategies between community colleges, minority-serving and Ph.D. granting universities, within the alliance and beyond and enhancing the integration of research and education.&lt;br/&gt;Internal assessment and external evaluation of the project will attempt to measure program effectiveness by answering questions such as: (1) how have retention rates and academic performance data changed during the course of the project? (2) how has connectivity with the community colleges changed during the project? (3) what has been the impact of graduate school preparation on students? readiness to engage in graduate studies? (4) in what ways has the project impacted inter-institutional cooperation and collaboration?</AbstractNarration>
