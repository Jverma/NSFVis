    <AbstractNarration>A light-weight, portable miniaturized oxygen concentrator that can produce &gt;90+ %O2 has been designed by the research team. This technology is one of the first to demonstrate air separation using a light-weight compact bench-scale unite capable of continuously producing 1-3 SLPM of &gt;90+% O2. The design of single column rapid pressure swing adsorption process integrated with a product storage tank requires minimum instrumentation and the adsorbent inventory is less than one third that of commercially available medical oxygen concentrators (MOC) in the market. In this project, a prototype unit based on the patented novel design concept will be built using miniaturized valves, flow and pressure sensors. A micro-processor based control algorithm will be developed for the operation of the cyclic adsorption process. Furthermore, the weight of the unit will be optimized using aluminum or plastic based material for the design and construction of the adsorption column. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miniaturization of a MOC design is a highly sought-after goal. A more compact MOC design will benefit millions of people who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and require home oxygen therapy. A portable MOC unit will provide greater mobility to these patients for exercise and improved cardiovascular health. A new 'Snap On' design of a miniaturized MOC system which can be used in conjunction with an existing compressed air source as in a hospital room or an industrial site can further extend the application of this product by eliminating the need of a dedicated air compressor. Other potential applications of this technology may be on-board oxygen supply in airlines and cruise ships, military camps, etc.</AbstractNarration>
