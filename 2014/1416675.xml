    <AbstractNarration>The INFORMS Computing Society NSF Student Poster Session is proposed to be held at the 2015 INFORMS Computing Society (ICS) Conference, which would be the first student poster session for the regularly-held ICS conference. This poster session is set up to encourage graduate students to interact with faculty, industry and fellow students by giving a technical poster presentation on a research project useful to operations research computing and related areas. The student poster session encourages students to engage in high quality, sound, and original research, strengthen their comprehension of research and research methods, and provide an opportunity for students to develop their effective writing and communication skills for the dissemination of research information, and become creative and self-reliant lifelong consumers of the knowledge. As such, the students will acquire necessary professional development skills to become an integral part of the operations research and computing profession. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experience gained through the professional development, the presentation of research, and the interaction with senior professionals in the field will positively affect the students' persistence to obtain a doctoral degree and practice in related fields. The abstracts of accepted posters together with the abstracts for other presentations will be published on the conference website. Students will also have the option to submit a paper to be reviewed for inclusions in the conference proceedings. If successful, the efforts supported by this grant will increase the number and diversity of operations research and computing professionals. The interaction of the students with known professionals in the field along with other students will assist in developing a network of colleagues to provide guidance to advance their careers.</AbstractNarration>
