    <AbstractNarration>Winston-Salem State University's (WSSU) Research Initiation Award entitled - Optimization of Heavy Metal Ions Remediation from Kaolinite Soil Using Molecular Micelles Chelator - is a student-faculty collaborative research project to develop a new analytical strategy for environmental heavy metal ion (HMI) remediation of contaminated soil. Specifically, the study will investigate the potential utility of molecular micelles (MMs) as chelators for HMI remediation of kaolinite soil. In addition, the HMI remediation efficiency capability of MMs will be compared with the remediation abilities of sodium dodecyl sulfate, a monomeric surfactant, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, a conventional chelating agent. Furthermore, D-optimum experimental design will be employed to simultaneously investigate the influence of experimental conditions to evaluate the best conditions for HMI remediation. Compared with the current available HMI remediation methods, the proposed study is more environmentally friendly, capable of HMI remediation of diverse environmental sample matrixes and requires few experiments, potentially reducing both the time and cost of analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is the development of a better analytical strategy for environmental HMI remediation and production of well prepared scientists through active student-faculty collaborative research. Emphasis on research engagement of students is not only the basis for gaining admission into graduate and professional schools, but it will also significantly strengthen WSSU's newly American Chemical Society accredited chemistry programs. The project aims to increase the number of minority students trained in research at a Historically Black College and University, ultimately improving students' learning and problem solving skills.</AbstractNarration>
