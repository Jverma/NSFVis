    <AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Prairie View A&amp;M University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to advance big data analysis with research in high performance computing. Source code from the project will be provided as part of a library under an open-source license in an effort to promote reproducible research within the signal-processing community. This research can have applications in areas such as homeland security, precision agriculture, and geospatial applications. The project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at Prairie View A&amp;M University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal is to advance the ability of analyzing digital data sets, including image, video, weather data, and DNA data sequence compression, with novel high performance computing (HPC) based signal processing techniques. The project will investigate how to increase the efficiency of data analysis, including image processing, video processing, and computer visualization, in a high performance computing environment. By efficiently integrating such technologies, the speed of the big data analysis processes will be dramatically increased and the analysis quality will be significantly improved. The project focuses on strategies for establishing an HPC based digital signal processing system, eventually extending these algorithms and simulations to other types of data sets.</AbstractNarration>
