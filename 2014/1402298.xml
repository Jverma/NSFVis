    <AbstractNarration>James Dickerson at Vanderbilt University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program for research focusing on the concurrent experimental and theoretical analysis of ultra-small rare earth-based nanoparticles of potentially high luminescence efficiency. This investigation will explore the synthesis, characterization, and theoretical modeling of these nanoparticles to assess the correlation among nanoparticle size, environmental conditions (symmetry, crystalline structure, surfactant properties, defects, etc.), and luminescence characteristics. By studying theoretically and experimentally the luminescence properties of these nanophosphors, such as doped gadolinium sesquioxide, it is possible to better understand how surfactant molecules, crystal distortions, and other nanoscale structural and electronic effects influence various spectroscopic processes originating from rare earth ions. The compounds chosen for these investigations [monodisperse, sub-3.0 nm europium (Eu2O3), terbium (Tb2O3), and doped gadolinium (Gd2O3:RE3+; RE = Eu, Tb) sesquioxide nanoparticles] have been selected due to their well-known, bulk phase luminescence characteristics, their simple crystallinity (bcc), and he unique expertise of this research group in the synthesis, the theoretical assessment, and the interpretation of their properties. The investigation of these nanocrystalline properties can be exploited in phosphorescent device applications ranging from robust video displays to bio-imaging reagents and infrared telecommunications materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award focuses on the concurrent experimental and theoretical analysis of the high-efficiency light emission characteristics of extremely small, nanoscale materials comprised of rare earth elements. This investigation will explore the production, analysis, and theoretical study of the properties of these nanoparticles to assess the relationship among their size, their intrinsic features, like symmetry and morphology, and their light emission characteristics. By studying theoretically and experimentally these materials, a better understand will be obtained of how to optimize their properties for use in phosphorescent device applications ranging from robust, ultra-high definition video displays to next-generation, high-acuity medical imaging reagents, and high-speed telecommunications materials. Diverse, underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this project thanks to existing programs at Vanderbilt University, such as the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge Program.</AbstractNarration>
