    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jeffrey S. Johnson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill examines novel and selective methods for carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond constructions with a focus on stereoselective variants that can be achieved with earth-abundant catalysts or with organic small molecule catalysts. New strategies and catalysts for the redox functionalization of carbon frameworks that take advantage of reactions that only use dioxygen (O2) for oxidation or dihydrogen (H2) for reduction are also under investigation. Again, a fundamental consideration in these studies is the identification of useful, highly active catalysts that are abundant, nontoxic and readily available and thus, this project focuses on sustainable chemistries. The efficient preparation of small molecule building blocks directly impinges on diverse and crucial areas such as human health (through the preparation of small molecule therapeutics) and technology (via the creation of novel materials). The advances made by this research play a fundamental role in providing sustainable access to these valuable building blocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is performed in collaboration with Professor Shuli You of Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry in China and Professor Luiz Dias of the Instituto de Quimica - UNICAMP in Brazil. Together, these groups combine their separate areas of expertise to convert readily-available feedstocks into value-added complex products useful to the chemical industry. Other broader impacts of this work include the training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students and an international exchange of ideas and expertise.</AbstractNarration>
