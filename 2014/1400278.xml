    <AbstractNarration>An appointed National Research Council committee will conduct the second phase of a study to consider future research goals and directions for foundational science in cybersecurity and how investments in foundational work support civilian and national security mission needs in the long term. It will consider relevant topics in social and behavioral sciences as well as more "traditional" cybersecurity topics. The committee will review current federal cybersecurity research strategies, plans, and programs as well as requirements for both civilian and national security applications. It will consider major challenge problems, explore proposed new directions, identify gaps in the current portfolio, consider the complementary roles of research in unclassified and classified settings, and consider how foundational work in an unclassified setting can be translated to meet national security objectives. In Phase 1, already completed with separate funding, the study committee conducted initial data gathering and analysis. In Phase 2, to be funded under this activity, the committee will undertake additional data-gathering, analysis and deliberations and produce a report providing a high-level roadmap for foundational cybersecurity research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foundational cybersecurity research that yields yield new technologies and approaches is an important element of the nation's response to the cybersecurity challenge. The results of this study are expected to inform future activities by federal agencies that conduct cybersecurity research and federal coordinating bodies for IT and cybersecurity. It is also expected to inform cybersecurity researchers as well as industry -- which is both a developer and consumer of cybersecurity technologies and services -- about needs, opportunities, and future directions.</AbstractNarration>
