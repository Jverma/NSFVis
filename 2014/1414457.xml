    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This award provides support for undergraduate and graduate student attendance and participation in the 21st Annual Southeastern Regional Yeast Meeting (SERYM) to be held on the campus of Vanderbilt University from March 14-16, 2014. This annual meeting provides a unique opportunity for yeast researchers from states in the Southeastern region of the U.S. to come together to share their preliminary research findings and discuss new research tools and emerging technologies. As model organisms, yeasts are ideal for the study of complex molecular, cellular, and biochemical processes. Researchers studying these simple eukaryotes have made significant contributions in areas as diverse as fungal evolution, DNA damage/repair, RNA processing, cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, prion propagation, autophagy and organelle biogenesis/ maintenance. This meeting, which is expected to attract between 100 and 125 participants, is the ideal venue for the inclusion of student presentations with the ultimate goal of facilitating interactions and discussions between students and senior scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This award will have broad educational impact for undergraduate and graduate student participants, by providing funds to defray travel expenses. Particular emphasis will be placed on increasing participation of individuals underrepresented in the sciences through the recruitment of both women and minorities. A key strength of this meeting is the opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students to present their research in platform and/or poster formats. The regional nature of this meeting provides opportunities for students to discuss their research work with leading scientists, laying the foundation for future scientific development and collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
