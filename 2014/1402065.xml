    <AbstractNarration>Coral reefs are shallow benthic communities that harbor the highest &lt;br/&gt;biodiversity in tropical seas. These ecosystems are endangered due to global climate &lt;br/&gt;change and anthropogenic pressure from coastal areas. Coral health has been &lt;br/&gt;decaying at unprecedented rates in the past decades and is therefore in need of &lt;br/&gt;immediate attention. A healthy reef requires a stable coral-algal symbiosis. Thus, &lt;br/&gt;understanding the processes required for this mutualism is fundamental for coral &lt;br/&gt;reef preservation. Examining how corals respond to bacterial pathogens can also shed &lt;br/&gt;light onto how host-pathogen interactions may be the same or differ from processes &lt;br/&gt;that affect symbiotic interactions. The use of high throughput gene expression profiling &lt;br/&gt;(transcriptomics) is a relatively new genomics approach that promises to enhance the &lt;br/&gt;study of these interactions. This project will examine the transcriptome as it varies &lt;br/&gt;from natural (i.e., healthy) to disturbed states (i.e., bleached or diseased) in two &lt;br/&gt;coral-algal symbioses from the Caribbean: the corals Acropora palmata and &lt;br/&gt;Montastraea faveolata and their dominant dinoflagellate symbionts. &lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research will contribute to the study of symbiosis as well as to &lt;br/&gt;applied fields such as conservation and management, including the development of &lt;br/&gt;coral health diagnostics. This project will train underrepresented minorities at the &lt;br/&gt;University of California, Merced. This new campus offers higher education and &lt;br/&gt;research opportunities to the disadvantaged Central Valley communities. This &lt;br/&gt;educational effort will be enhanced by a partnership with the DOE Joint Genome &lt;br/&gt;Institute to develop a course in Genome Biology. Students will also have the &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to be involved in environmental podcasting through the UC Merced &lt;br/&gt;website in three languages representative of the Central Valley populations &lt;br/&gt;(English, Spanish and Hmong). The project will also continue with successful &lt;br/&gt;outreach activities in collaboration the California Academy of Sciences through &lt;br/&gt;teacher training workshops.</AbstractNarration>
