    <AbstractNarration>This funding is for the conference "Curves and Automorphic Forms" to be held at Arizona State University from March 10th to 14th, 2014. There will be approximately 10 speakers and an anticipated 75 participants. The theme will be extensions of the modularity theorem for elliptic curves over the rationals. Talks will describe work on computations of elliptic curves over number fields and of hyperelliptic curves over the rationals, on the conjecturally corresponding modular forms (e.g., Hilbert, Siegel, Bianchi), and on associated L-functions. The format will be a hybrid of a traditional conference and a workshop with lectures in the morning and afternoons devoted to collaborative work. We hope that bringing together experts on these various objects will encourage collaborations in new directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By its very nature, the conference seeks to connect different areas of mathematical research, and thus should be useful in exposing researchers of all levels to ideas which have increasing importance. The grant includes funding for graduate students, postdocs, young researchers, and mathematicians from underrepresented groups. We hope that the conference will draw not only mathematicians who work directly in these areas, but also others from neighboring areas of mathematics. Part of the workshop activities will be to incorporate results from computations into the L-function and Modular Form Database, http://www.LMFDB.org, which provides data and information on mathematical objects for both researchers and a general mathematical audience.
