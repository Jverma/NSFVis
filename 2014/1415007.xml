    <AbstractNarration>Human impacts on the natural world are of growing and increasingly urgent concern. Utilizing information about the causes and conditions of ecosystem health, this study contributes to the broader scientific understanding of degraded marine ecosystems. Such understanding in turn benefits decision-makers and the general public in identifying conservation and management priorities. This project will investigate the claim that jellyfish excel and multiply rapidly in degraded (or less pristine) marine conditions, using data from Japan as a case study. The study will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shin-Ichi Uye, an expert on jellyfish at Hiroshima University. The Sea of Japan is an especially useful location for analysis because there is a robust dataset on jellyfish occurrences, combined with an ecosystem that has been significantly impacted by human activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, the term "jellyfish" refers to species within the phylum Cnidaria that have a free swimming (medusa) stage in their life history. A framework for defining marine ecosystem degradation has been recently advanced. This study will overlay human impact data with jellyfish location data. The datasets will be compared and analyzed for correlation. Information is lacking about the role of jellyfish in either healthy functioning or degraded ecosystems. This study aims to answer the question of whether occurrences of jellyfish, especially in large numbers, are correlated with degraded systems. The hypothesis is that jellyfish abundance and occurrence patterns in Japanese seas will be strongly correlated with a degraded marine environment. This project will advance knowledge of jellyfish dynamics and their role in the ecosystems they inhabit, and also inform the process of measuring and understanding ecosystem degradation. The outcomes will contribute to the ability to employ science, conservation and management in the ocean. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
