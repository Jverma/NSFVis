    <AbstractNarration>Correlated electron systems is a rapidly developing subject, driven both by high-resolution and novel measurement techniques and remarkable recent theoretical developments. The 2014 Gordon Research Conference on Correlated Electron Systems: Textures, Topology, and Strong Interactions, June 22-27, 2014 at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA consists of a broad swath of emerging ideas such as novel spatial textures, such as nematic textures in the iron-based superconductors, magnetic skyrmions in metallic magnets, the control of non-equilibrium behavior in correlated superconductors and topological insulators, the exploration of the limits of electric transport in correlated systems, the role of spin-orbit interactions in such systems, and the ever increasing impact of topological protection. It is very likely that new technologies will emerge from these ideas that will lay the foundation for the next generation of electronic devices. This award will support student and postdoc participation at this Gordon Research Conference. Supported participants will have the opportunity to participate in the associated Gordon Research Seminar Correlated Electrons In Extremo: Frustration, Topology, and Ultrafast Dynamics, June 21-22, 2014 at the same location.</AbstractNarration>
