    <AbstractNarration>SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellow Santiago Juarez's archaeological research (under the mentorship of PI Palka) is relevant to the analyses of complex societies. This project investigates how the actions and activities of members of an ancient community influenced the construction of an early urban society during the Preclassic (2500 B.C.-A.D. 200) period at a recently discovered Maya site in Chiapas, Mexico. During each field season, Juarez and other project members present their latest findings through conference style papers (which include illustrations, figures, and reconstructions) during community gatherings. Additionally, this project integrates students from the University of Illinois at Chicago during the survey, excavation and laboratory phases. Broadening participation of a diverse group of people in the scientific workforce is one the stated goals of this project; as such, the research provides an opportunity to train students in archaeological methods to develop relevant experience and provides undergraduates with data for theses. Both the PI (Palka) and Fellow (Juarez) have demonstrated a strong commitment to increasing the participation of minority students in scientific research. In this project, students not only receive hands-on training in archaeological research methods, especially in skills such as mapping and GIS technology that are in high demand, but also in developing their own research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By focusing on models of social organization, this research explores the relationships and interactions that sustained this ancient community during a period of massive growth and change. This project is expected to reconstruct how people of all levels were involved in the urban formation processes; results of this work could add new depth to the study of state-formation and the rise of civilization by focusing on the social and economic practices of all residents of a community. Military force, royal marriage alliances, and diplomacy are often seen as key catalysts in the development of Preclassic Maya urbanization; although such processes were indeed important in the expansion of ancient communities, Juarez proposes that the actions of common people played an equally important role in the growth and expansion of trade networks and economies. Overall, this project provides a holistic understanding of one of the earliest urban societies in the Americas. Ultimately, such knowledge not only advances the field of archaeology but also contributes to understanding, protecting, and celebrating our rich and diverse cultural heritage.</AbstractNarration>
