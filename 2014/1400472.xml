    <AbstractNarration>This award provides student travel support for the 19th Annual International Conference on Architecture Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS) to be held from March 1-5 2014, in Salt Lake City, Utah. ASPLOS is the premier conference for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and compilers, operating systems and networking, as well as applications and user interfaces. The importance of such cross-cutting research continues to grow as we grapple with the end of Dennard scaling, the explosion of big data, scales ranging from ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, the need for sustainability, and increasingly human-centered applications. ASPLOS embraces systems research that directly targets these new problems in new ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups. To broaden participation, the grant is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students who cannot otherwise attend, that is, students who do not have any financial support whatsoever, e.g., from their advisors, departments, universities. The broader impacts include building international community and cooperation in the research areas of the conference, and enhancing education of students with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. This award will therefore help train the next generation of architects, operating systems builders and language designers in interdisciplinary integration of their respective skills.</AbstractNarration>
