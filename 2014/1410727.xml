    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This project develops techniques to grow large single crystals of important materials for use in optics that are otherwise difficult to prepare and study. Many of the efforts focus on a fundamental study of fields such as new laser materials. These materials will add to the basic scientific understanding of new laser applications, new display technologies and new detector science. The primary support will be for the training of graduate students particularly those working toward the Ph.D. degree. They are being trained to perform research in crystal growth, characterization and properties of new materials for optical applications, an area that is generally underdeveloped in the US. Student interactions with industrial and national laboratory collaborators will be supported. The broader impacts of this work will enhance the expertise of the next generation of materials and expand the capacity of US researchers in optics and lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project employs the use of hydrothermal fluids, namely aqueous phases between 500-700 C and 1-2kbar for fundamental explorations of new solids. These conditions provide a unique medium for the exploratory growth of new materials, particularly in the form of large, high quality single crystals. This program focuses in particular, on single crystals that can serve as hosts for optical applications including lasing, up-conversion and scintillation. The emphasis is on metal oxides and halides that can be selectively doped with optically active ions. The goal is to discover and identify new phases that can be made in this unique reaction medium, and to study their structural and spectroscopic properties. There are three broad thrust areas under investigation, the novel chemistry of beryl-based oxides, the host chemistry of vanadates, and the fundamental exploratory chemistry of metal tantalates and niobates. In all cases, new structural types will be sought and their subsequent spectroscopic and optical properties will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>
