    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID grant funds mapping and small-scale testing of imminently threatened archaeological resources at the Shaktoolik Airport heritage site (NOB-072) in northwestern Alaska. The research team visited this site in 2013 and noted a large concentration of more than 25 late Thule (ca. &lt;AD 1400) to early contact period ?house? depressions. This house concentration includes what appears to be a communal or ceremonial men?s house (Karigi/Qargi in Inupiaq or Qasgiq in Yup'ik), a structure that has been documented ethnographically but rarely investigated archaeologically. However, this site is located on a low-lying spit of land that is in immediate danger of being destroyed by coastal erosion and flooding from increased ocean storminess and river outwash. In addition, melting permafrost is lessening artifact and site preservation ? something that once made the Arctic an exceptional place for archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this RAPID is high. Given the number and density of dwellings, this site is unique to the Thule period in Alaskan prehistory. The potential for a ceremonial house increases the uniqueness of the site, as such features are rare in northern Alaska. In addition, this particular site spans the prehistoric to historical period, which was a time of considerable cultural, economic, and social transformation including massive epidemics commensurate with the end of the Little Ice Age and collapse of the northern caribou population in the mid-1800s (i.e., Yup'ik territories were contracting and Inupiaq territories expanding). Shaktoolik site was the nexus of early trading among Inupiat, Yupiit, Athbaskans, Russians and Americans and has the potential to shed light on the role this early historic period and its shifting economic and social alliances played in the Inupiat expansion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the Airport site is located on the outskirts of the Native village of Shaktoolik it offers an excellent opportunity for local community involvement in the research, and thus the broader impacts for this project is also high. PI Darwent has developed a robust plan for the inclusion of community members in the research, including training and directly employing local youth in the site testing. In addition, the exploration and mitigation through mapping and testing of the site will assist the scientists and community members in gaining a deeper understanding of local and regional cultural heritage, and has the potential to safe guard important information for future generations, community members and scientists alike. In addition, the research offers training to UCD graduate students and potential for future dissertation projects.</AbstractNarration>
