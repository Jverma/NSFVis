    <AbstractNarration>Current processors employ aggressive prediction mechanisms to improve &lt;br/&gt;performance and reduce power. To design effective optimizations, it is &lt;br/&gt;increasingly important to understand and quantify a program's dynamic &lt;br/&gt;behavior. However, today, most of these optimizations rely on &lt;br/&gt;heuristics and are fairly ad-hoc. After some patterns are observed, a &lt;br/&gt;hardware decision is made and the design space of the hardware &lt;br/&gt;optimization is explored through simulation to determine the best &lt;br/&gt;performing configuration. However, because the design is targeted for &lt;br/&gt;observed and/or anticipated patterns, some dynamic behavior is not &lt;br/&gt;captured and remains undetected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a framework for quantitatively analyzing a &lt;br/&gt;program's behavior in terms of regularities and patterns to provide &lt;br/&gt;insights into the design of next-generation hardware prediction &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms. Inspired by DNA discovery tools, the research adopts &lt;br/&gt;algorithms used in string processing, compression and bioinformatics, &lt;br/&gt;in order to summarize applications' dynamic data reference and branch &lt;br/&gt;outcome behaviors. The findings from the methods and tools developed &lt;br/&gt;in this project will have a big impact on the design and efficiency of future &lt;br/&gt;hardware components. The PI will collaborate with industry partners to further &lt;br/&gt;increase the broader impact. The research will engage graduate and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students and promote the participation of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
