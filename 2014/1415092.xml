    <AbstractNarration>The fungal pathogen associated with the disease white-nose syndrome, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has caused catastrophic declines in hibernating bat populations across eastern North America. This disease now threatens several species in the United States and Canada. The current known distribution of P. destructans includes a large portion of the European continent, but bat populations in Europe have not experienced the same declines as bats in North America. The pathogen is now believed to have long coexistence with European bats, but has only recently been introduced to the United States. No one knows whether P. destructans exists in temperate Asia. Determining the global distribution of P. destructans is important for understanding the origins and global threat of white-nose syndrome. Conditions in China are suitable for pathogen growth and spread, and large numbers of hibernating bats exist in cave habitats in China. In this study P. destructans will be sampled across northeastern China in collaboration with Professor Jiang Feng at Northeast Normal University, a leading expert in bat ecology in China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 10 caves and mines where bats hibernate during winter across northeastern China for P. destructans will be explored. Samples will be collected from soil and wall substrate, specifically targeting locations where bats roost during winter. Using molecular techniques, samples will be tested at Northeast Normal University for the DNA of P. destructans. Presence of P. destructans in China will show a broad distribution of this pathogen in temperate climates across the Euro-Asian continent. Alternatively, if P. destructans is not present in China, the introduction of this pathogen could pose a major threat to Chinese bat populations. This study will provide critical information on the global risk of human-mediated movement through international caving expeditions of P. destructans to Asia. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
