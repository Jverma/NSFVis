    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves acquisition of an X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) instrument at Kettering University to support materials research, integration of research and education, and outreach programs. With the development of new degree programs at Kettering, new initiatives in innovative materials research have been launched with participation across disciplines and involving external industrial and academic partners. The XPS provides much-needed capabilities to enable the projects to significantly advance their objectives and make important contributions. On-campus availability of XPS also strengthens integration of teaching and research, with incorporation of the equipment in classes spanning physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial engineering. Additionally, this equipment significantly enhances the unique undergraduate research experience at Kettering. Kettering has a long history of outreach activities for local youth, in which faculty members open research laboratories and equipment, including characterization instruments such as XPS, and create engaging demonstrations that highlight the relevance of such technologies in everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument is a Physical Electronics X-Tool model, designed specifically to reach a wider audience by adding automatic and easy-to-use features, without compromising full capabilities to obtain elemental identity and quantification, chemical states, depth profiles, and chemical surface mapping. The research activities supported by the XPS equipment are addressing a multitude of scientific problems across disciplines, including advanced coatings to improve medical implants, improvement of materials for dentistry and orthopedics, materials to improve disease treatment and imaging, lightweight materials for transportation, enhancement of battery technology for electronic vehicles, development of protective coatings, materials for energy storage to address increasing energy demand, and membranes to improve biogas production, among others. While the specific objectives vary by project, general goals and scope include development of innovative materials and coatings, process characterization, and tailoring the materials to meet the objectives. The data from the XPS is evaluated to determine and quantify the links between the process parameters, the material chemical properties, and the application performance.</AbstractNarration>
