    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop plasma gas-liquid reactors to produce chemical disinfectants (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) through plasma formation. Previous support from NSF has provided knowledge of the basic chemical reactions and the mechanisms for the formation of reactive species including hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide in small laboratory scale reactors where non-thermal plasma contacts with liquid water. The research team has discovered that higher efficiencies can be obtained when plasma formed in the gas phase contacts a flowing liquid film or an aerosol of water droplets and used this to develop a reactor system. The reactor system developed is quite simple, durable, and robust. While it is currently of relatively small laboratory scale, we expect that the scale up can be addressed so that the system can have a potential impact on the market for small processing plants and perhaps personal use where portability and low unit expense are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new technologies for disinfection, water cleaning, and chemical oxidation can address many public health and environmental problems as well as improve industrial efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;Small scale efficient gas-liquid plasma reactors may find wide use in a variety of such applications.</AbstractNarration>
