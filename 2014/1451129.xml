    <AbstractNarration>This project funds a workshop that brings together researchers from the US and Korea, for the purpose of describing and assessing the impact of advanced networking on the engineering of smart cities. Researchers who specialize in programmable networking, including SDN (software defined networking) and NFV (network function virtualization) will work with leading researchers interested in the broad areas of smart cities, including enabling technologies such as large-scale sensor and actuator deployment (wireless and wired) and the Internet of Things (IoT) as applied to the smart city application domain. Research in smart cities has a clear benefit to society, in improving the lives of people through the use of technology, including in the domains of energy efficiency and health-care delivery. However, techniques for how to structure secure, reliable, and flexible networked communications in support of smart cities is poorly understood. The workshop will explore and document key technology challenges and opportunities that arise when next generation networking and smart cities are considered together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held August 16-17, 2014, in Chicago, Illinois. Potential US participants will be invited to submit one-page abstracts of their interest and ideas in the workshop areas. These abstracts will be reviewed by the US workshop organizers, and approximately 20 participants will be selected. This proposal supports travel expenses for the US participants only; Korean participants are being selected and funded by their national agencies.</AbstractNarration>
