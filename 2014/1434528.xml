    <AbstractNarration>Global patterns of biodiversity demonstrate that most of the species on earth occur in the tropics, with strikingly fewer species occurring in higher-latitude regions. Biologists predict that this global pattern of species diversity is likely shaped by thee ecological interactions between species. Yet few detailed experimental data exist that demonstrate how species interactions influence natural communities from the tropics to the arctic. Therefore, a significant opportunity exists to transform our understanding of how these fundamental species interactions shape patterns of biodiversity across the globe. Furthermore, these species interactions have the strong potential to limit potentially harmful biological invasions by non-native species, which are often transported by human activities that can breach historical dispersal barriers, such as ocean basins and continents. Biological invasions can cause undesired ecological and economic effects and are considered one of the primary drivers of global change. Through extensive field research on marine ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North and Central America, from the tropics to the subarctic, this project will study ecological factors that shape global patterns of diversity and limit biological invasions. Undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will be fully-integrated members of the research team. The objective of mentoring these early-career scientists will be to integrate scientific, professional, and cross-cultural training into a comprehensive professional development framework that will prepare them for a successful scientific career in an international forum. The research team will further promote awareness of marine and invasion ecology through a suite of activities, including outreach and educational activities for school children and young adults in Philadelphia, Alaska and Panama. Information that can be applied to the management of non-native species will be disseminated to a wide diversity of U.S. and international stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biologists have long theorized that the latitudinal diversity gradient may be shaped by stronger species interactions, such as competition and predation, occurring in the tropics than at higher latitudes. Prior research suggests that predation pressure is indeed stronger at lower latitudes, but it is unclear how interactive effects of predation and competition structure communities to maintain these diversity patterns in ecological time. This project represents an international research program to expand ecological understanding of species interactions across latitude. The objectives are to determine the relative influences of two primary species interactions, competition and predation, on patterns of species diversity, community assembly and sensitivity to species invasion. Field research will employ a large-scale experimental approach that focuses on sessile marine invertebrate communities across 47 degrees of latitude (over 7000 km). Experiments will manipulate levels of predation and competition for one year and will be conducted in four regions, ranging from the subarctic to the tropics: Alaska, California, Mexico, and Panama. Communities of sessile marine invertebrates, composed of both native and non-native species, will be examined iteratively under different predation and competition regimes to evaluate community dynamics. The relative importance of a suite of factors, including environmental conditions and recruitment rates, to interaction outcomes will be evaluated.</AbstractNarration>
