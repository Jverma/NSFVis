    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is for the acquisition of a one-ton capacity shake table to be used predominately for research on the stability of rock boulders and slopes during seismic loading. As evidenced by the large number of structures destroyed and the number of people killed and injured during the Christchurch series of earthquakes, rockfalls and rock slides are serious potential dangers during earthquakes. The shake table will be used to investigate the mechanisms causing rock falls and slides with the objectives of identifying potential hazardous areas and developing methods of mitigating these hazards. Additionally, the shake table will be used for research on methods of isolating structures from seismic ground motion through base isolation techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-ton shake table will be acquired. The shake table will be delivered with the equipment to allow 1-D shaking, but could be expanded to allow 2-D shaking in the future. A unique feature, designed to allow data collection involving systems of multiple rock blocks, is a high-speed side-view video camera synched to the machine control system. Historically, a significant volume of shake table research has been done in the fields of structural engineering and structural dynamics, and soil mechanics and (soil) slope stability; much less has been done using rock or rock-like materials, as proposed here. Research activities to be enabled by the shake table include: 1) Response of Blocky Rock Systems to Seismic Loads, 2) Use of Precarious Blocks to Provide Estimates of Historic Shaking, and 3) Development/Testing of Inexpensive Infrastructure Base Isolation Systems, among others. The shake table will significantly enhance the research capabilities of Montana Tech, a primarily undergraduate institution. Use of the shake table will be incorporated into labs in two undergraduate engineering courses.</AbstractNarration>
