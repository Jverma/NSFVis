    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to continue Stevens Institute of Technology participation in the CyberCorps速: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to prepare highly-qualified Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the government workforce. Holding the designation as Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education since 2003 and Center of Academic excellence in Information Assurance Research since 2008, Stevens offers a wide range of Cybersecurity-focused degree programs - ranging from highly technical programs to broader curricula geared toward software assurance, security engineering, privacy, ethics, or risk management aspects. The proposed project will add three key innovative components: (a) research engagement of all scholars through faculty-guided independent study projects in Cybersecurity; (b) development of "soft skills" for all scholars through short courses in leadership, project management, innovation and entrepreneurship; and (c) implementation of a novel pathway in Cybersecurity education between Stevens and community colleges in the tri-state area. The NSF?s CyberCorps速 SFS program funds projects that address Cybersecurity education and workforce development. The Scholarship Track provides funding to award scholarships to students in Cybersecurity. In return for their scholarships, recipients will work after graduation for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government organization in a position related to Cybersecurity for a period equal to the length of the scholarship. The Capacity Track seeks innovative proposals leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce Cybersecurity professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the Stevens CyberCorps速 SFS scholarship project has provided funds for 11 scholars, including two scholarships awarded in the context of a pilot program between Stevens and Union County Community College. About 40% of students belong to demographic groups that have traditionally been under-represented in the computing sciences. Furthermore, the proposed program includes the implementation of a pathway from 2-year colleges into Stevens, whose successful outcome would serve as a model for other institutions. Stevens CyberCorps速 SFS Scholars will be at the forefront of advances and developments in the field. They will participate in a bi-weekly scholar research seminar with two components: Cybersecurity faculty presenting on their research and scholars giving an update on their own research spanning from hardware-focused security, quantum cryptography, network and software security, to privacy and economic aspects of security.</AbstractNarration>
