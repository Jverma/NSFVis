    <AbstractNarration>Physicists' understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena has surpassed the stage of simple observation and measurement. Advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) and condensed matter physics (CM) have enabled explorations into the control over quantum systems with a goal of achieving quantum engineering. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers award the Physics Frontiers Center at the Joint Quantum Institute (PFC@JQI) will build on research conducted during the previous award to study many-body physics by the controlling and monitoring of quantum complexity in a systematic way. This will be done by both the intricate building and examination of materials using a wide range of platforms spanning both AMO and CM. The PFC@JQI will continue to reach out to underrepresented groups through programs such as the Summer Girls Program which is a two-week intensive, hands-on physics program for high school students. The Center will also participate in other outreach and education programs geared to a range of audiences from the general public to K-12 students to graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PFC@JQI will investigate experimental and theoretical areas related to quantum many-body physics at the interface of AMO and CM. Research areas will include: studies of topological matter (where energy bands determine the nature and behavior of the matter) such as Majorana fermion physics and new platforms for programmable topological matter; the use of quantum optical systems to explore many-body physics through coupling between, or mediated by, photons in atomic or photonic media; and the study of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of many-body interacting systems using atomic and condensed matter systems through a close collaboration of experimentalists and theorists.</AbstractNarration>
