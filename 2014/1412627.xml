    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the 2014 Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium that will take place at the University of Texas at Austin during the Fall 2014 semester. The Symposium will focus on the area where probability theory, dynamical systems theory, spectral theory, and partial differential equations intersect and interact. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of the past symposium can be found at the website of the meeting: https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/tc/TeXAMP/TeXAMP-2014/TeXAMP-2014.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, and the University of Texas at Austin. It is intended for the participation of around 50 people (including 25 non-local graduate students). The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have a chance to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 8 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
