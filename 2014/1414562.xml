    <AbstractNarration>This project is to create some components to aid in the forthcoming joint scientific conference on Water Systems, Science, and Society Under Global Change to be co-sponsored by UCOWR, NIWR, and CUAHSI and held on June 18 - 20, 2014 at Tufts University. The goals of the joint conference are (1) Integration of National Water Resources Communities to Advance Science. (2) Translating Research to Practice and (3) Networking and Mentoring of Early Career Researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will trigger intellectual conversations relating to future directions in water system research with a particular emphasis on identifying those potential areas of new scientific knowledge discovery that will amplify our ability to solve future water management challenges under global change impact. The participants will benefit from understanding new possibilities and opportunities provided by the three national level organizations and the communication that will essentially leverage the intellectual strengths and reputations of these organizations including CUAHSI, UCOWR, and NIWR. The feedbacks from the audience will also impact the three organizations.</AbstractNarration>
