    <AbstractNarration>As technology advances, the tendency for modern electronic devices is to decrease in size while improving battery life and speed. As the integrated circuits (ICs) that make up our modern day devices continue to increase in performance they are running into physical limits. Electronic communication creates a bottleneck that limits speed and consumes power. One approach to further improve the performance of IC interconnect is to move from the electrical to the optical domain. Using light for communication offers several advantages over electrical signaling. On-chip integration of optical devices is considered to be a next frontier in high performance electronics. IBM's Tokyo Research Lab is one of the leaders in optical research for computing systems, developing high-speed optical systems towards the goal of developing the first optical supercomputer. In collaboration with Dr. Yoichi Taira, an expert in optical research at IBM in Japan, this project will provide a new insight on the research regarding high-speed communications in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photons are not subject to many of the same parasitic effects (such as capacitance) that slow down electrical signals. IBM has a comprehensive internal effort in developing the next generation integrated circuits and the use of optical interconnect approaches to improve overall integrated circuit performance. In this project, two important components of planned optical interconnect systems will be evaluated. First, the quality of optical waveguides will be measured using advanced techniques, including scattering and loss measurements using integrated photodetectors and external modulated lasers. Using the same strategies, the maximum communication speed using these optical interconnect systems will also be measured and validated using a code generator/validator and high speed electrical measurement equipment coupled to the photodeetctors. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
