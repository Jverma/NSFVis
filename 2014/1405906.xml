    <AbstractNarration>Dependability is a requirement for computer systems; however, research&lt;br/&gt;on dependable systems is hampered by a lack of real and publicly&lt;br/&gt;available failure data. This can result in productive paths of&lt;br/&gt;research being closed to most researchers and, conversely,&lt;br/&gt;unproductive research being performed due to faulty assumptions about&lt;br/&gt;the manner in which real systems fail. The goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;plan a collaborative effort to collect, curate, and provide public&lt;br/&gt;access to failure data for large scale computer systems through a&lt;br/&gt;community repository. One challenge is that failure data is&lt;br/&gt;considered sensitive by the owners. The ultimate goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to collect the data from some of the NSF-funded large&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure projects, such as NEES, LIGO, XSEDE, and NRAO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goal of this planning project is to collect requirements&lt;br/&gt;from potential praticipants (both users and contributors of data sets)&lt;br/&gt;and seed a prototype repository with data sets from two of the largest&lt;br/&gt;and latest clusters at Purdue. The data sets will comprise static&lt;br/&gt;information, dynamic information about the workloads, and failure&lt;br/&gt;information, for both planned and unplanned outages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact in the project will be achieved through the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of the data sets to a wide variety of researchers, and&lt;br/&gt;perhaps even, practitioners. The datasets will let people run their&lt;br/&gt;campus clusters more efficiently, i.e., with fewer failures, at higher&lt;br/&gt;utilization and energy efficiency.</AbstractNarration>
