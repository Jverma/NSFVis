    <AbstractNarration>This research project concerns the study of examples of topological gauge theories in low dimensions. Gauge theory, in special cases, is believed to underline the mathematical description of the universe; for example, the standard model for particle physics is a gauge theory in 4 dimensions. Much mathematical research into quantum physics over the last half-century has focussed on the analysis required to make accurate experimental predictions, but what was missed until the last decade or two was that topological (distance-independent) features of the theory are governed by an underlying algebra, which has some novel and unexplored features. The PI will study fundamental questions pertaining to this algebra in low dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main project aims at a rigid description of topological gauge theory (the so-called A-model) by the tested technique of mirror symmetry, which converts "soft" topological questions, defined up to coherent systems of homotopies, into rigid questions of analytic or algebraic geometry. The PI has a proposal for the mirror of pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions, which controls the gauging and 2-dimensional gauge theories such as arise from symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian group actions. Another component of the research involves gauge theory in 3 dimensions, specifically Chern-Simons theory, which seems to lie half-way between the soft A- and the rigid B-model. Finally, a small project involving representation theory (geometric Langlands duality for algebraic curves) will be undertaken: the construction of a generic Langlands kernel for simply laced groups, which relies on cohomological and algebro-geometric techniques, but the subject is informed and inspired by electric-magnetic duality for gauge theory in 4 dimensions.</AbstractNarration>
