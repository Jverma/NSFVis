    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Vincent Conticello of Emory University is designing structurally defined, nanometer-sized two-dimensional assemblies from peptides, a basic structural building block of proteins. A major challenge to science at nanometer scale dimensions is the ability to prepare structures with complete control over their sizes, shapes and chemical compositions. Biology has shown that peptides, chemically linked sequences of amino acids, can assemble into a range of well-defined structures, so Professor Conticello is learning how to make synthetic versions of peptides and discover the rules by which they can be assembled into sheet-like structures. The development of these relatively environmentally benign fabrication methods will promote the design and synthesis of nanoscale assemblies for use in a variety of applications that utilize optical, electronic, magnetic, or biological functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet this challenge, the Professor Conticello employs synthetic peptides of defined sequence and molecular architecture. The molecular-level information is utilized within a given structural context to direct highly specific intra- and inter-molecular interactions that promote self-assembly of thermodynamically stable and structurally defined two-dimensional assemblies. Synthetic peptide structural motifs, including the collagen triple helix and the alpha-helix, are being examined as building blocks for the creation of the nanosheet assemblies. Structural characterization methods (X-ray fiber diffraction, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy) are employed to define conditions to control the growth of the two-dimensional assemblies. Experimental conditions are being defined that will promote the integration of the nanosheet assemblies into more complex structures as a prelude to the creation of functional devices. Under the direction of Professor Conticello, and in conjunction with the graduate students involved in this project, an outreach program is planned that will recruit undergraduate and high-school students to work on these inter-disciplinary studies at the interface of chemistry, biology, and materials science. In addition, a one-semester seminar session of the Emory course ORDER, On Recent Discoveries by Emory Researchers, is planned as a potentially sustainable trial to connect faculty, graduate students, post-docs and other materials-oriented investigators within the local EMORY community, to engage undergraduate students in order to more fully develop the connection between biological molecules and materials.</AbstractNarration>
