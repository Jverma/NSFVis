    <AbstractNarration>Predicting earthquakes is a difficult task, due largely to a limited understanding of the complex physical processes involved. Computer simulations allow researchers to better understand such processes, but the current models are limited in terms of the problem size that they can handle. Improving these computer models could provide insight into seismic events, such as earthquakes, and possibly aid in prediction. This project will focus on improving an existing software package for modeling Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events. This research will be conducted at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in collaboration with Dr. Zongyan Cao, an expert with the Xeon Phi Coprocessor, Intel's new chip that will be used in the computer simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ETS events occur where continental plates meet, and they are characterized by weak, long-term tremors with acute seismic events occurring periodically. A novel mathematical model has been proposed to describe ETS, and subsequent computer simulations closely match observed GPS data. This model describes a system of shearing and fluid release. As two plates slide along each other, heat is produced, ultimately causing a dehydration reaction to occur. The result is a release of high-pressure fluid, which acts as a lubricant, resulting in a slip event. Additionally, the fluid absorbs heat, and the whole system cools and returns to it's original state. The code for this chemo-mechanical oscillator model is limited in size and scale; it currently only runs in one dimension and in serial. This research seeks to develop a parallel version of the code that is capable of handling multiple dimensions and multiple time and length scales. Intel's Xeon Phi Coprocessor will be used, in part due to its ease of programmability, but also because the next generation of HPC systems will make use of accelerator technologies like the Xeon Phi. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
