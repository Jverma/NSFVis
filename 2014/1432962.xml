    <AbstractNarration>A series of short cruises aboard R/V Point Sur with the principle aim of training early career oceanographers to conduct research at sea.&lt;br/&gt;The need to improve the skills of early career scientists has been recognized by UNOLS as well as Program for several years. Previous similar activities conducted on the West and East Coast under Clare Reimers were highly successful, and this effort would build on those experiences. MLML proposes a series of UNOLS Chief Scientist Training Cruises to provide opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for teaching early career marine scientists how to effectively plan for, acquire, utilize and report on, time at sea for multi-disciplinary research projects and education. These cruises, to be held on the R/V Point Sur in 2014, they will also offer new investigators opportunities to test preliminary or unfamiliar research methods, work collaboratively, with others and acquire samples and experience critical for developing future oceanographic programs for both research and education. Because berthing is limited on Point Sur, the plan is to run three short cruises and a series of day cruises. This approach will allow for a large number of participants, but will also provide opportunities for several participants to lead a cruise.&lt;br/&gt;The funding for the cruise is modest.&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this activity will be the results from the expedition to a scientifically important and interesting area. The activity is not just a "look and see", but rather "learning from doing" real science. The proposals lays out a very organized and proven time table for meeting the objectives. &lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the activity are the majority focus. Training the next generation of sea-going scientists is essential to maintaining effective US oceanography. It is particularly important at this juncture as the Academic Research Fleet downsizes and modernizes. This consideration, as well as advancement in technology to support field work, mandates that new users become familiar with capabilities that are rapidly evolving. This is one reason behind shifting the paradigm from learning through osmosis from seasoned veterans to actively participating in modern oceanography. The experiences of the previous generation are rapidly becoming less relevant to the careers of the up-and-coming scientists of tomorrow.</AbstractNarration>
