    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support to the International, Mind, Brain, and Education Society (IMBES) conference, scheduled to be held at University of Texas at Arlington in November 2014. The conference emphasizes translating what is known from educational neuroscience research to educational practice, in effect taking the latest brain-based research and using it to improve education. The award supports presentations related to the neural basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning, including participation costs for researchers, educators, and students. This project helps the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program, within DRL (Division of Research on Learning), fulfill its goal of supporting the STEM education research community as it pursues innovative research methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics covered at the conference include affective aspects of learning, physical components of early cognitive development, neuroscience education, special education, memory, implications of embodied cognition for early STEM education, brain-based teaching techniques, and informal science education. The conference includes keynote speeches, symposia, workshops, general paper sessions, and poster sessions.</AbstractNarration>
