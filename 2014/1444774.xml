    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) Technology Translation (TT) project focuses on translating controlled drug delivery technology to fill the need for faster and better wound healing. The controlled delivery of growth factor is important because it keeps the growth factor active longer in the body so as to accelerate wound closure and potentially reduce scar formation as well. The project will result in a prototype of a wound dressing. This dressing will protect the bioactivity of growth factors and control their release. These features provide the following advantages: accelerated wound healing, reduced dressing changing frequency, reduced cost of care when compared to the leading competing wound dressing based on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Furthermore, the one-time therapy can be easily used by patients or their family care givers, thus reducing cost compared to products that require professional handling such as vacuum therapy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) Deciphering the polyvalent interactions between the components of the controlled release system. 2) Knowledge on how to regulate the release kinetics using ionic interactions. 3) A delivery system that can protect the bioactivity of a wide range of proteins in various biotechnological and biomedical applications. These gaps will be bridged by 1) Varying the polycation of the controlled release system. 2) Adjusting the composition of the controlled delivery vehicle and the dosage of the growth factor. 3) Using heparin in the delivery system, thus allowing the controlled release of greater than 200 heparin binding proteins including heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, PDGF and fibroblast growth factor. In addition, graduate students and post-docs involved in this project will receive technology translation experiences through participation in the "Benchtop to Bedside" and the "Academic Entrepreneurship" courses and University of Pittsburgh Big Idea Competition.</AbstractNarration>
