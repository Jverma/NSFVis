    <AbstractNarration>The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of an award for summer internship support. HACU, a national, non-profit organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship opportunities through the organization?s National Internship Program (NIP). Through NIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico have received quality internship assignments through various federal government agencies. Participants are exposed to various career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping students make informed career choices and solidify career objectives. By partnering with public and private sector partners, HACU has been able to successfully place over 10,000 students in internships since NIP commenced in 1992. In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating government agency, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Internships create a unique opportunity to assist in the preparation and engagement of a future STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers of science and engineering research. By integrating research and education, the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the human capital infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education and research.</AbstractNarration>
