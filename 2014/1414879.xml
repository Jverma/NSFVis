    <AbstractNarration>Mindfulness is described as nonjudgmental awareness on the present moment. Grounded in Eastern religions, mindfulness has gained recent attention in psychological research due to its association with positive well-being. Mindfulness-based therapies are associated with decreased stress and anxiety as well as increased social emotion and behavior. In contrast, certain personality traits, can serve as risk factors for higher levels of depression and anxiety. Overall, the current proposal investigates whether levels of mindfulness mediate the relationship between personality traits and levels of anxiety and depression in nonclinical populations in Japan and America. This study will be conducted at the University of Tsukuba under Dr. Shintaro Yukuwa, a current researcher of mindfulness and emotion. Expecting differing levels of the proposed variables due to culture and religion, it is essential that the proposed study be conducted in an East Asian country to bridge the literature gap between Western-conceived mindfulness and Eastern religious mindfulness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to advance the scientific literature on personality traits, clinically-relevant symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety), and facets of mindfulness through comparing data between populations. Of more clinical interest, correlation and mediation analyses will allow us to see how mindfulness occurs in individuals and how it relates to pertinent variables. Also of significant interest is exposure to natural disasters and degree of religiosity. By better understanding the multifaceted relationship of mindfulness, personality and clinical measures, psychologists can better help those suffering from mental conditions and create preventative methods for those at risk of developing clinical problems. Mental illness can often be greatly reduced in severity: understanding risk factors, such as personality traits, and ameliorating variables, such as mindfulness, can have a significant impact in psychology and international society in general. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
