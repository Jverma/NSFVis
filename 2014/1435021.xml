    <AbstractNarration>Bioavailable iron is arguably the most important nutrient for shaping the distribution and composition of marine primary productivity and, in turn, the magnitude of ocean carbon export. Iron exists in many phases throughout the world's oceans, and colloidal, or non-soluble, phases comprise a significant fraction of dissolved iron. However, the size and physical/chemical character of these phases is presently poorly understood. To better understand this key part of iron cycling, researchers will use new analytical chemistry methods to quantitatively separate the colloidal iron sizes present in a sample and measure the composition of these colloidal portions in shelf and oceanic waters. Results from this study will help hone future studies to better link the source and fate of iron in the marine environment. A postdoctoral researcher will serve as a principal investigator on the project, providing a unique professional development opportunity. In addition, the project will support the education and research training of one undergraduate student each year, and the researchers will conduct outreach activities to K-12 students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colloidal phase of iron may serve as a biological source of stored iron, a primary conveyance for stripping iron into sinking particulate matter (removing it from the pelagic biosphere), or, more likely, a dynamic balance of these roles that fluctuates with the source and character of iron input. The current methods to investigate marine colloidal matter involve operationally defining the bulk colloidal phase using single cutoff filters, a practical decision based on little or no evidence. More problematic, these methods homogenize the colloidal phase, obscuring what almost certainly is a reactivity spectrum of colloidal species tied to their size and compositional character. In this study, the researchers will use Flow Field-Flow Fractionation coupled to Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering to make measurements of the uniformity or uniqueness of the colloidal size spectrum, and the physical/chemical character of these phases. The findings will have broad implications to the fields of marine ecology and biogeochemistry and, ultimately, to modeling studies of ocean-atmospheric coupling and climate change.</AbstractNarration>
