    <AbstractNarration>This proposal outlines a Workshop for Aspiring PIs in Cyber-Physical Systems. The invitation-only workshop will take place over 1.5 days, and include early-career researchers with interests in cyber-physical systems who have not previously been funded by the NSF CPS solicitation but who have submitted proposals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will help aspiring PIs understand what NSF (and importantly, the panels convened by NSF) are expecting to see in a successful CPS proposal. The workshop will include exciting talks by CPS program grantees as well as NSF CPS Program Officers, along with panel discussions with researchers as well as program officers. The agenda also plans significant time for discussions between aspiring PIs and panelists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enlarge the CPS research community. It will help early-stage researchers better understand CPS program goals, provide opportunities for interaction with program leadership, and result in significant improvement in the quality of CPS project ideas from the community and better alignment with program goals.</AbstractNarration>
