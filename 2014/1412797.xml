    <AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting the three day 19th edition of the GENI Engineering conference (GEC), including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be held Mar 17 - 19, 2014 at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. Both the conference and the demonstration session will be held at the University or in university owned conference facilities in order to minimize costs. Event planning and logistical support for GEC 19 will be coordinated by a team from GaTech?s Institute for People and Technology which has extensive experience in conference planning and support at the local, national, and international levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three GECs per year, in which the entire GENI community meets to review current status, and to decide on subsequent steps in GENI's evolution. The GECs include community-based working groups leading GENI's design and planning, and demonstrating progress with live experiments. About 250 to 300 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse US institutions will gather in Atlanta to showcase their ideas and results. In the demo session over 35 live demos will be provided with a wired connection to the GENI infrastructure. The demo evening will be held in the first floor event space of the Technology Square Research Building located immediately across the street from the conference hotel and will be provided with high-speed connectivity to Internet2, the NLR, and the SoX regional network. Each GEC demo project will be issued with temporary campus-wide wireless credentials that will grant access to the campus wireless infrastructure and commodity Internet for the duration of the demo evening. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEC meeting and demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research, this project supports the continued development and community development of that instrument.</AbstractNarration>
