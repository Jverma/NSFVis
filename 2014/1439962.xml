    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Response of Novel Magnetic Nanoparticle Suspensions to Time Varying Magnetic Fields&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Carlos Rinaldi, Assistant Professor&lt;br/&gt;Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This career development plan combines the PIs expertise in modeling and magnetorheological&lt;br/&gt;characterization of suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles in Newtonian fluids (ferrofluids) with&lt;br/&gt;synthesis and preparation of novel magnetically active complex fluids such as suspensions of&lt;br/&gt;spherical magnetic nanoparticles in non-Newtonian fluids and liquid crystals and suspensions of&lt;br/&gt;non-spherical nanoparticles in Newtonian fluids. The response of these novel magnetic fluids to&lt;br/&gt;time varying magnetic fields will be studied through a combination of modeling and experiments&lt;br/&gt;using AC susceptometers, magnetic birefringence, and magnetorheometers coupled with the&lt;br/&gt;Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry method. The education and outreach components of the plan aim to increase the participation and enhance the education of underrepresented groups such as Hispanics through: (1) science demonstrations at underserved pre-college schools in Puerto Rico and hosting of pre-college teachers in the laboratory during the summers, (2) seminars on research ethics and manuscript and proposal preparation aimed at establishing a Research Culture at UPRM, and (3) development of the course Introduction to Chemical Engineering Research. Prior NSF investments in education and outreach will be leveraged by partnering with the UPRM Science on&lt;br/&gt;Wheels Educational Center (SONWEC) and the UW Madison MRSEC Interdisciplinary Research Group (IEG) to translate educational modules for pre-college audiences into Spanish, to be used in Puerto Rico and with US Latino communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Novel magnetically-active complex fluids will be developed and their response to time varying magnetic fields will be characterized experimentally and theoretically. Suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles are of recent interest in nanobiosensors derived from the hydrodynamic size dependence of the magnetic relaxation time, and in magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment of cancer. In these applications the particles are typically embedded in a non-Newtonian fluid matrix and the response to oscillating or rotating magnetic fields is of key concern. The proposed research is of fundamental interest in colloidal hydrodynamics, rheology, nanotechnology, and will help develop applications of magnetic nanoparticles in sensors and cancer treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: By carrying out the proposed research at the UPRM, the participation and education of students from underrepresented groups will be significantly enhanced. The Chemical&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Department at UPRM serves over 650 Hispanic undergraduate students, 70% of which are female. There are also 27 PhD students, half of which are Hispanic US citizens. The proposed seminars and the course Introduction to Chemical Engineering Research will integrate and formalize research activities in the education of undergraduate and graduate students while developing a Research Culture in which students will learn the values, traditions, and responsibilities of being a researcher. The proposed outreach and education tasks will impact thousands of Hispanic pre-college students through the SONWEC and IEG. Research-based educational materials will be developed for use in teaching Spanish-speaking communities in Puerto Rico and the US. The PI will also provide meaningful research experiences for pre-college teachers during the summer.</AbstractNarration>
