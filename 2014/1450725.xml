    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to conduct a feasibility study on a new type of optical switch. If the proposed&lt;br/&gt;technique is successful this EAGER project will impact a key component in optical communication, and data centers &lt;br/&gt;in particular. By harnessing a radically different switching mechanism, the electric field induced dynamic waveguiding&lt;br/&gt;effect in nanodisordered potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) crystals, the PI hopes to obtain optical switching performance&lt;br/&gt;that cannot be achieved through current technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional optical switches designed for data center and optical communication, and based on changing the phase in the&lt;br/&gt;travelling path, produce an interference that switches from constructive to destructive as the phase is varied. Such a &lt;br/&gt;switch is limited in that it operates at a specific wavelength of light. In the proposed research the on-off switching&lt;br/&gt;could be efficiently achieved with very low switching power, and for a broad range of wavelengths. The project will check&lt;br/&gt;the feasibility of such a concept by fabricating and characterizing a 1x2 switch. Since data centers (in particular) require&lt;br/&gt;a growing number of switches, and are faced with growing power consumption limitations there is a critical need for such &lt;br/&gt;a technology. With the selection of nanocrystal potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) the proposed work has the potential to &lt;br/&gt;produce ultra-fast switching with low power consumption, in a broadband transmission, while maintaining low cross talk,&lt;br/&gt;high extinction ratio and small footprint.</AbstractNarration>
