    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the organization of the workshop entitled "Workshop on Combinatorial Approaches to Functional Materials", which will focus on identifying key challenges in the Materials Genome Initiative that would benefit from the application of theoretical and experimental combinatorial techniques. The meeting will be targeted towards senior and junior scientist from academia, government, and industry across a wide range of materials specific applications: including materials for energy, electronics, and catalysis. A series of lectures will be given on the first day by topical experts emphasizing both current state-of-the-art and future directions in combinatorial materials synthesis and metrology, electronic materials, energy-related materials, catalytic materials and the integration of experimentation with theory. A series of targeted breakout sessions, led by senior and junior scientists, will follow the lectures and provide a discussion of current challenges, visions and strategies for moving the field forward. The discussions will culminate in the creation of a Roadmap entitled "Strategies for Maximizing the Impact of Combinatorial Strategies on M.G.I. in Fields of National Need." The roadmap will be shared with industry, academia, government agencies, and Congress with an aim towards increasing support and utilization of combinatorial methods for increased materials commercialization and deployment. The organizers will make a concerted effort to include underrepresented minorities in the workshop by actively identifying leading underrepresented scientists in the field and inviting them as lecturers or to participate as breakout session leaders. An additional perspectives article will be generated to be disseminated to the scientific community highlighting current challenges and future directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the organization of the workshop entitled "Workshop on Combinatorial Approaches to Functional Materials", which will focus on identifying key challenges in the Materials Genome Initiative that would benefit from the application of theoretical and experimental combinatorial techniques.

The organizers will make a concerted effort to include underrepresented minorities in the workshop by actively identifying leading underrepresented scientists in the field and inviting them as lecturers or to participate as breakout session leaders. An additional perspectives article will be generated to be disseminated to the scientific and general communities highlighting current challenges and future directions.</AbstractNarration>
