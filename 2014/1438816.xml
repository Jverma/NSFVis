The 43rd ICPP conference, which is a premier conference in parallel and distributed systems. A committee for elect travel awardees will be setup. The first priority will give to students who are from under-represented minority and female. The second priority will be given to those who normally could not attend the conference. Besides technical paper presentations, the venue offers a wide range of technical activities including panels, industry presentations, posters, demos, and keynote talks. Attending such high-caliber technical venues is extremely valuable for future researchers. This award enables the supported attendees to be exposed to the state-of-the-art research in the field, to have the opportunity to interact with peer graduate students, researchers and experts from all over the world, to further gain knowledge that is likely to shape the future of the field (e.g., in terms of technology, standards, etc).</AbstractNarration>
