    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The development of advanced materials is widely recognized as one of the key elements behind emerging technologies that can potentially achieve a sustainable environment and provide adequate, clean energy for our planet. This proposal is focused on the synthesis and characterization of Zintl phases with potential for thermoelectric applications. Zintl phases are a class of compounds that have already shown significant promise, changing the landscape of energy conversion by doubling the efficiencies of devices made with these materials. This proposal has broader impacts associated with training of the next generation of scientists, enabling them to tackle transforming materials needs over the next several decades. This proposal supports minorities and women at the initial stages (high school to college (ACS SEED program) and college to graduate school (Mentorships for Undergraduate Research Participants in Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MURPPS), along with training graduate students for scientific careers. Students collaborate with scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to understand and enhance the efficiencies for materials with promise for thermoelectric applications. Students develop scientific, social, and professional skills through hands-on training, exploration, and dissemination of research to the broader scientific community. Fundamental training in materials synthesis and structure-property correlations provides an important foundation for the development of thermal to electrical energy conversion and the advancement of multidisciplinary research aligned with technology. The research will be presented at national and international meetings and the findings published in peer-review journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Thermoelectric materials convert heat directly into electricity or vice versa. With support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project focuses on the synthesis of new Zintl phases, incorporating transition metals and earth abundant elements in order to target a high density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (through partially filled d orbitals) to obtain high Seebeck effect (Power factor) and therefore high zT. Phases will be synthesized as single crystals, high purity powders and pellets via flux, metallurgical routes, and spark plasma sintering. Utilizing a suite of physical characterization techniques including single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, SEM, elemental wave dispersive microprobe, parallel electrical and magnetic measurements, the structure and phase composition will be correlated with electronic and thermal transport properties. The ultimate goal of this project is to discover new materials with high zT for the direct conversion of waste heat into electricity. Building upon recent results of demonstrated high zT in Zintl phases, this proposal closely links synthetic strategies with characterization of physical and chemical properties, thus providing efficient feedback to guide improvement of these thermoelectric systems.</AbstractNarration>
