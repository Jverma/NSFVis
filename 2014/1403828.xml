    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1403828&lt;br/&gt;Mohseni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heat is an unavoidable byproduct of the normal operation of an electronic device, generated as a result of electrical energy being converted to thermal energy during circuit activities. An increase in speed of an electronic system is often achieved by reduction in circuit delay due to higher circuit packaging densities. Unfortunately, this is accompanied by increased power dissipation per circuit. As the need for fast electronic devices increases, the ability to remove heat flux effectively and efficiently is in greater demand. To this end, the ability to safely dissipate large amounts of heat from very small areas is key to many of today's cutting edge technologies. Reducing heat fluxes by an order of 100-1000 W/cm2 and beyond is currently encountered in high performance supercomputers, power electronic devices, electric vehicles, advanced military avionics, radars, and lasers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed investigation will explore the active and on-demand micro actuation and transport of liquid droplets, a process termed Digitized Heat Transfer (DHT), for effective thermal management of high-power compact systems. The DHT technique has two main advantages. First, the use of individual droplets and the subsequent introduction of recirculation zones inside the droplets allows for an increased heat removal rate as compared to continuous liquid-cooling flows as well as air-cooling systems. Second, the droplets may be discretely manipulated, enabling it individual, instruction-based programming of fluid processing, where droplets are transported, mixed, reacted, stored, and analyzed in packets without the need for moving mechanical parts. This capability of DHT is aptly-suited for transient thermal management and the suppression of temperature overshoots during the dissipation of power spikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the technical advances in thermal sciences, fluid dynamics, and computational techniques anticipated above, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in these topics. Undergraduate research assistants will be sought via supplementary REU support, and can be expected to come from the previously mentioned fields. The PI intends to develop a course in micro-scale transport at the University of Florida and expand his current course on micro and nano thermofluidics with the addition of both a fabrication and a computational component. The PI's existing multidisciplinary courses will be enriched with results from this work, expanding student exposure to different aspects of micro fluidics.</AbstractNarration>
