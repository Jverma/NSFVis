    <AbstractNarration>The 72nd Device Research Conference will be held at held at the University of California, Santa Barbara from held June 22 to 25, 2014, and will address research areas in the field of semiconductor electronic and optical devices including novel device concepts. It is one of the few conferences where the latest results are presented and discussed in a relatively open format. This conference will foster advances in the leading research on various types of semiconductors, by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. DRC gathers the brightest members of the research community under an interactive, intellectually stimulating meeting. The program provides the opportunity for scientific exchanges and discussions. There are approximately 10 invited talks and 110 contributed (oral and poster) presentations.</AbstractNarration>
