    <AbstractNarration>The Laguna del Maule volcanic field, located in central Chile, is currently uplifting at a rate among the fastest ever measured at a volcano that is not actively erupting. For the last 20 thousand years, volcanism at Laguna del Maule has been dominated by rhyolite, an uncommon volcanic rock that commonly erupts explosively. The distribution and compositions of recent rhyolites suggest that they are the product of a large, shallow magma reservoir that persists to this day. To understand the relationship between the ongoing uplift and a future potentially large, explosive eruption, it is critical to characterize the magma dynamics that preceded the most recent volcanism. The composition of minerals crystallized in the most recent rhyolites record the changing temperature, pressure, and chemistry of the Laguna del Maule magma reservoir. This research will consist of measuring compositional variation within individual crystals and utilizing numerical models to estimate the timing of the changes in the state of the magma reservoir relative to the subsequent eruption. This research will be performed at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in collaboration with Dr. Fidel Costa, a pioneer in applying these numerical modeling techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plagioclase and quartz compositions will be measured using electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS. The measurement of multiple trace elements with varying diffusivities will provide the most accurate relative ages. The intrusion of mafic magma into the shallow silicic magma system at Laguna del Maule could potentially have imparted the observed mineral zonation, triggered the recent eruptions, and be driving the ongoing unrest. Understanding the dynamic response to such and event is critical to assessing the volcanic hazard at Laguna del Maule and the assembly and eventual eruptions of voluminous rhyolitic magma reservoirs. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>
