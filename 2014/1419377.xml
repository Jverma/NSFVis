    <AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting the three day 20th edition of the GENI Engineering Conference (GEC), including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be held June 22-24, 2014 at the University of California, Davis. Both the conference and the demonstration session for GEC 20 will make use of university facilities, the UC Davis Conference Center , Buehler Alumni Center, and the Kemper Hall. There are three GECs per year in which the entire GENI community meets to review current status, and to decide on subsequent steps in GENI's evolution. These GECs include community-based working groups leading GENI's design and planning, and demonstrating progress with live experiments. About 250 to 300 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse US institutions will gather for GEC 20 to showcase their ideas and results. In the demo session over 35 live demos will be provided with a wired connection to the GENI infrastructure. The demo evening will be held Ballroom A-B-C (combined) in the UC Davis Conference Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI is an instrument designed to address three issues: &lt;br/&gt; - Science Issues: We cannot currently understand or predict the behavior of complex,&lt;br/&gt;large-scale networks.&lt;br/&gt; - Society Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience.&lt;br/&gt; - Innovation Issues: Substantial barriers to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the- wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today?s Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research. This project supports the development and use of the research instrument.</AbstractNarration>
