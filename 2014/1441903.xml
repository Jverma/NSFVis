    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the grant is to encourage the research interests and involvement of students who&lt;br/&gt;would otherwise be unlikely to attend HPDC due to a lack of funding, underrepresentation in&lt;br/&gt;the field, lack of institutional tie to the HPDC community, or other reasons. The impact on&lt;br/&gt;these students? education and enthusiasm for research in high-performance computing and distributed&lt;br/&gt;systems will be high. They will have the opportunity to witness first hand cutting edge research,&lt;br/&gt;presentations, and discussions, an experience they would likely not otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HPDC seeks to increase student participation in the symposium as well as the field in general.&lt;br/&gt;The funding will support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients&lt;br/&gt;will be able to attend the main conference and associated workshops. Travel grants will encourage&lt;br/&gt;the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded&lt;br/&gt;and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering&lt;br/&gt;it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
