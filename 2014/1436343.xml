    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Jackson State University seeks to improve African American students' academic performance and retention in STEM fields through enhancing their awareness of their own abilities to learn complex STEM subjects, improving their ability for selecting and using cognitive and metacognitive strategies, monitoring their learning process and making necessary adjustment in their learning efforts. The findings from the project can be used to inform future practice in and research on developing expertise of STEM faculty and assisting students to acquire self-regulated learning skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the following three objectives: 1) To provide STEM faculty members with professional development opportunities for obtaining skills and knowledge in educational theories through implementing the self-regulated learning assessment and by participating in a teaching community with learning scientists; 2) To provide African American students with deliberate training opportunities in multiple STEM courses for improving their skills for effectively managing their STEM learning efforts and obtaining a deeper understanding of the subject through implementing the self-regulated learning assessment in their STEM courses; and 3) To provide evidence-based data to confirm the effectiveness of proposed faculty professional development model and student skill training model and to identify factors that can facilitate obtaining desirable outcomes from the two models. The proposed activities and strategies are evidence-based and the implementation is guided by an evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
