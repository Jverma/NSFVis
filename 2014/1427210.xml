    <AbstractNarration>NSF Abstract: International Workshop on Urbanization in Watersheds: Ecological and Environmental Responses&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 1427210, NSF IIA- Catalyzing New International Collaboration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical project description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China has experienced unprecedented urbanization in recent decades, and Chinese decision makers are now seeking scientific guidance on sustainable water management in urbanizing area. China has enormous potential to incorporate novel "green infrastructure" into its urban development and potentially sustain water resources through the use of green roofs, rain gardens and optimized placements of parks and green space. With support from the U.S. National Science Foundation a group of U.S. investigators (senior faculty, young faculty, and graduate students) will work with their Chinese counterparts to develop approaches for comparative studies of urban watersheds in the U.S. and China. The scientists will build upon on approaches used in U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites in Baltimore and Phoenix. Collaborative research will be fostered through a research development workshop on "Urbanization in Watersheds: Ecological and Environmental Responses" to be held in Xiamen China from October 12-17, 2014. The Institute of Urban Environment (IUE), Chinese Academy of Sciences, will serve as the in-country host institution and the University of Rhode Island will coordinate the U.S. efforts. The project has the potential to fundamentally transform urban watershed research in China by catalyzing collaborations with scientists from the U.S. that have training and experience in the transdisciplinary studies that are fundamental to progress in this area. At the same time, the project has the potential to transform urban ecology in the U.S. by exposing U.S. students and early career scientists, several from underrepresented groups, to the challenges and approaches that have been taken to urban ecosystem studies in China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of NSF funding a group of Chinese and U.S. scientists will jointly develop research questions and approaches to foster understanding of the mechanisms, drivers and responses of watersheds to urbanization. A workshop will be held in Xiamen, China in October, 2014 to generate new international collaborations with the Institute of Urban Environment (IUE), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, China and other urban ecosystem researchers in China. The workshop will seek to establish collaborations between terrestrial and aquatic scientists and to cultivate links between biophysical scientists and managers interested in watershed applications. Approaches for comparative studies of urban watersheds in the U.S. and China will be based on insights gained from the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network. The workshop will lead to grant proposals for integrated, comparative watershed research in the U.S. and China to NSF programs in Ecosystem Studies, Coupled Natural Human Systems, Coastal Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability, and Water Sustainability and Climate. In addition, there will be an emphasis on developing opportunities for students and young scientists based on approaches taken in the U.S. NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program.</AbstractNarration>
