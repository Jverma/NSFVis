    <AbstractNarration>This project supports a series of scientific workshops among Alaska Native, Hawai'ian Native, and Plains Indian indigenous scholars and scientists. The goal of these workshops is to engage the participants in developing new guidelines for building collaborations between Native and non-Native researchers working with Native communities. The research team proposes that these guidelines reflect Indigenous knowledge production, honor Indigenous innovation, and resonate Indigenous perceptions of place and as such, they will incorporate Native principles, protocols, and practices. This approach to scientific collaboration, one that supports scientific and indigenous principles as co-producers of scientific knowledge creates a new vision for interdisciplinary research, one that includes scientific and indigenous scholarly perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As scientists increasingly engage Native communities in research as subjects, landowners, tradition bearers, participants, and/or collaborators in research there is increasing awareness among indigenous people, particularly in North America, that the scientific endeavor could benefit greatly from their knowledge and perspective. This project is about understanding the diversity of indigenous knowledges and how indigenous people can best engage with science and scientists. This type of multi-knowledge engagement holds the potential to expand our understanding of the world's natural and social systems. In addition, this project engages the next generation of Alaska Native, Native Hawai'ian, and Plains Indian scholars and scientists through meaningful participation by undergraduate and graduate students and early career scientists from these groups. By engaging students from underrepresented groups in science through this workshop series, the research team proposes to prepare the next generation of interdisciplinary scientist that can think and analyze data in a more holistic way. They are in essence laying the groundwork for a 21st century diverse scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
