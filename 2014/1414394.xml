    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an innovative dieless forming technology to fill the need for rapidly producing three-dimensional sheet products either for prototyping or for real-applications. The project will result in a desktop prototype machine ? hybrid tri-pyramid robot - for the double sided micro-incremental forming process. This tri-pyramid robot has the following unique features: the ability to manipulate an object by generating three orthogonal translational output motions in space and the ability to provide an adaptive clamping mechanism on the workpiece material. These features provide the following advantages: a machine with higher load/weight ratio, stiffness and accuracy when compared to the leading competing technologies; and a flexible forming center that does not require geometric specific tooling, which has not existed in this market space. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: a novel translational parallel manipulator, an integrated model of combined meso-micro positioning system, and an adaptive clamping mechanism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Scimplicity LLC to perform technology demonstration using commercial products that are currently made with the traditional deep drawing or stamping process in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid tri-pyramid robot is important because it will be able to rapidly produce products with micro-complex-precision features such as fuel cell bipolar plates, membranes, heat exchanger plates, spray nozzle heads, etc. The ability to create such features/products will find applications in aerospace, medical instruments, electronics, fiber optics, precision laboratory equipment, etc. In addition, the potential economic impact is expected to be expanded to areas of high precision milling, positioning stages, high speed manipulation for pick-place operations, and general robotic assembly operations in the next 3-10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
