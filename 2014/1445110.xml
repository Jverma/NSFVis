    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for five US-based researchers and partial support for ten students/postdocs to participate in the 16th Latin American Mathematical Logic Symposium (SLALM) to be held on the Campus of Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 28-August 1, 2014. The SLALM is the largest inter-American meeting in mathematical logic. It was established in 1970 to strengthen working relations between logicians in the United States and Latin America. Thanks in no small part to the success of these relations, today, mathematical logic thrives in Latin America. While the amount of research activity and the number of specialized conferences of international prestige that are held in the region continues to grow, the SLALM remains the largest inter-American logic conference. Since inception, the SLALM's have been organized in the form of a working conference preceded by a series of training tutorials aimed at students. The tutorials, the plenary talks, and the special sessions aim to represent major areas of mathematical logic. The SLALM has a strong tradition of being a student-focused event. The tutorials that precede the conference are attended by students from Latin America, the United States, and Canada. For the US students, the SLALM is a unique opportunity to attend lectures and tutorials given by some of the world's top logicians. The meeting is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic. Abstracts of the talks have been published in the Bulletin of Symbolic, one of the three official journals of the Association.</AbstractNarration>
