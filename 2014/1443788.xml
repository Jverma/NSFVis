    <AbstractNarration>A new center is to be planned based at Iowa State University and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign named the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Doubled Haploid Research (CeDHR). CeDHR plans to provide the basic research foundation necessary for the applied research goals of industry and will make the process of Doubled Haploid line production both more effective and available in species where it is currently unavailable. The research scope, comprised of four primary areas, is unique among I/UCRCs: 1) Isolation of genes involved in the haploid induction and genome doubling process, 2) Establishment of a DH system in species, where it is not available yet, 3) Efficient screening procedures for haploids, and 4) A novel concept of an in vitro nursery including automation of this process and methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to meet the projected increase of global demand for food, feed, and fibre (100% by 2050), the efficiency, reliability, and speed of genetic improvement must be accelerated. The mission for the proposed Center will be to streamline and link the efforts of industry and academia towards speeding up plant breeding using doubled haploid (DH) through a formalized and extended research partnership. Students and postdoctoral researchers within the proposed Center will receive professional development training at both ISU and UIUC. In addition, industry representatives have indicated their need for scientists with multidisciplinary undergraduate or graduate training; a primary goal of the Center will be to address this critical training and educational need. Center trainees, including minorities and underrepresented groups, will be drawn from diverse backgrounds. Research findings will be disseminated internationally.</AbstractNarration>
