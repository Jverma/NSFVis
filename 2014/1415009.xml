    <AbstractNarration>Steel Special Moment Frames (SMFs) are one of the most commonly used systems to mitigate the effects of earthquakes throughout the world. After the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquakes, severe damage to steel moment frames, in particular the connections between the beams and columns, was observed. Previous research stated that hollow structural sections (HSS) increase the efficiency of columns in SMFs, but this configuration can be particularly difficult because of the geometry of hollow structural sections. There is a need for a simplistic, economically viable connection detail that performs adequately under seismic excitation. The first phase of this project will focus on the enhancement of beam-to-column connections between HSS columns and wide-flange beams. The second phase will be an investigation into the elimination of welding in beam-splices by utilization of a specialized adhesive. This project will be a collaborative effort with Dr. Taichiro Okazaki, a renowned expert in the area of steel structure beam-to-column connections, structural mechanics, and earthquake engineering at Hokkaido University in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beam-to-column sub-assemblage specimens will be tested using a quasi-static loading protocol, simulating the effects of seismic excitation on SMFs. Subsequent tests will be carried out to improve the performance of the connection and mitigate the effects of plastic flow restraint and low-cycle fatigue. Then, the results will be analyzed and used to develop a pre-qualified moment connection. In addition, wide-flange adhesive beam-splices will be tested under both three and four point bending. The results of the tests will be used to derive a design equation for the interaction of shear force and bending moment. The NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
