    <AbstractNarration>The Alaska Community-based Monitoring (CBM) Best Practices Workshop will be held April 1-2, 2014 in Anchorage, Alaska. This workshop will engage funders and program managers of CBM projects and programs and community members engaged in CBM, which involves dialogue and interaction between scientists and non-scientists. The development of a viable model for planning, implementing, and sustaining CBM throughout Alaska and in the Alaskan Arctic will provide the means to ensure a diversity of people become engaged in science and that scientific results are shared broadly with the communities affected by the research. Because of the nature of Alaskans engaged in CBM, the workshop will engage underrepresented minorities in science and technology. It will also increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology, and develop partnerships between academia and others. A major potential benefit to the well being of individuals in society will be realized by future contributions of CBM efforts to the detection significant environmental changes that require community or societal responses to mitigate, adapt to, or reverse. The funding requested would make it possible to offer the workshop free of charge to participants, complete planning, invite and pay travel costs for successful practitioners as speakers, pay facilities costs, and use the results of the workshop to write a CBM Best Practices manual applicable to Alaska and the Arctic.</AbstractNarration>
