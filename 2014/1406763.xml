    <AbstractNarration>The Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering, provide emerging engineering leaders from academia, industry, and government laboratories the opportunity to share research insights to facilitate an interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and research methodologies. The symposia serve as a catalyst to spur engineering innovation and foster collaborative networks of researchers within the United States and between engineers from the United States and partnering countries. This award provides partial support for three FOE symposia, to be held in 2014: Japan-American FOE (to be held June 9-11, 2014, in Tokyo, Japan), United States (U.S.) FOE (to be held September 11-13, 2014, in Irvine, California), and the European Union (EU)-U.S. FOE (to be held during November 2014 in Seattle, Washington). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each FOE symposium will focus on four topical areas. The four topics planned for the Japan-American FOE symposium are energy harvesting and power transmission, field robotics for disaster response, bioimaging, and noise control engineering in health care environments. The four topics planned for the 2014 U.S. FOE symposium are next-generation robotics, frontiers in materials for batteries, impacts of shale gas and oil on the economy, environment and energy sustainability, and technologies for the heart. Finally, the four topics planned for the EU-U.S. symposium are energy storage across scales, smart homes, protein design for therapeutic applications, and design/engineered aerospace materials. About 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each two and one-half day symposium will include four formal sessions, technical tours, break-out sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions will consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. Papers from the U.S. FOE symposium will be published in a volume available on the National Academies Press website at http://www.nap.edu.</AbstractNarration>
