    <AbstractNarration>This grant will provide partial support for American postdoctoral, graduate, and advanced undergraduate students to participate in the 4th Graduate Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas, an international educational workshop which will be held from July 30th to August 8th, 2014 at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey. The project objective of this summer school is the educational dissemination of the current knowledge of this new field, the advancement of the current scientific challenges, and the promotion of the potential technological opportunities provided by complex plasmas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4th Graduate Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas will focus on dusty and strongly coupled plasmas, reactive plasmas, microplasmas, quantum plasmas, and plasmas in contact with surfaces. The summer school will provide a broad overview yet rigorous curriculum that will lead to further advancement in this emerging field by seeking to attract young American researchers in significant numbers since they will encounter scientific challenges as well as technological opportunities upon which they can build successful academic or industrial careers. A further benefit of this program is that complex plasma applications appear to be a potentially very fertile field for small, high-tech start-up companies which will perceive this subject as a encouraging innovation source for marketplace realization of new plasma technologies.</AbstractNarration>
