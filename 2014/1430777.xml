    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will eliminate remaining barriers to the production of bamboo fibers for use as a reinforcement in polymer composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be an increased usage of sustainable materials, increased revenue for US agriculture, and increased domestic and international sales of a new and innovative product line. Success in this project will also lead to domestic job creation needed to support the research, manufacturing, and sales of these composites. The processes to be finalized during this Phase II project will support the growth of a nascent based on US-manufactured, environmentally-friendly products. Within three years of launch, it is expected that over $4 million in revenue will be generated by sales of bamboo fiber. Moreover, increases in bamboo cultivation as a result of these new products will help mitigate adverse environmental impacts and improve public health. This will be done by the inherent sequestration of carbon dioxide in the plant growth cycle, and a reduction in the pollution associated with the use of high-energy glass fiber and plastics processing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Phase II project will address the following research topics: species variations, manufacturability, additional high value products, additional composite properties, processing and treatment optimization, and commercial scale-up. The team will assess the mechanical and physical implications of variations in feedstock by the use of filament tensile testing. Surface treatments specific to bamboo fibers will be finalized, with the goal of increased fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, mitigation of water absorption, and compatibility with at least three major resins systems. These treatments will be evaluated via composite tensile testing, filament testing and water immersion testing. Manufacturing studies will be performed to verify compatibility with commercial scale manufacturing equipment. The design and manufacture of a small scale, batch plant will address technological and automation challenges. This plant will provide a bridge to a commercial-scale plant designed to produce 6 million pounds of fiber yearly. Additional innovative aspects to the project lie in the assessment of a bamboo species compatible with climates in the US, automation of raw bamboo processing, and implementation of a fully optimized multi-step material functionalization process.</AbstractNarration>
