    <AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to partially cover participant costs for beginning scientists at the 14th Symposium on Study of Earth's Deep Interior (SEDI). The meeting will be held in Tokyo, Japan from August 4-8, 2014. This proposal will contribute to interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and beginning researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and inter- national collaborations on a broad range of topics that contribute to our understanding of the deep Earth and other planetary interiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earth's Deep Interior. The ultimate goal of SEDI is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, chemical and dynamical state of the Earth's deep interior and of the effect the interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The 'deep interior' is generally considered to be the core and lower mantle, but interest often extends to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth's deep interior, material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs.</AbstractNarration>
