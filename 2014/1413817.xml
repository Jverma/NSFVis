    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the fall 2013 Future Internet Architecture (FIA) principal investigator meeting. The meeting enables PIs to discuss four topics: 1) the management of faults, which includes detection, localization, isolation/avoidance/working around them, and repair/recovery; 2) routing where the interest here is not the complete details of how the schemes are currently doing routing, but what the different approaches provide as foundations for routing, and what they require from a routing protocol; 3) the Internet of Things (IoT), which is of interest to several of the projects that have a point of view about sensors, machine to machine (M2M), etc.; and 4) performance, since most of the FIA proposals do not distinguish themselves from the current Internet on the basis of simple performance improvements (e.g., efficient use of links), but do raise different and interesting questions about aspects of performance. The goal of this session is to tease these questions out and compare the FIA proposals in this light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The discussions of these topics lead to a better focus by the various FIA projects on key issues, such as network management, which have not received high-level attention in previous FIA meetings. The discussion also lays the groundwork for a more substantive discussion of security, perhaps at the next meeting in spring 2014. The discussions of routing and performance tie the FIA efforts to some more traditional topics of network research. The discussion of IoT provides a lens into the applicability of the different FIA proposals for an important application space. The intention is that these discussions provide an in-depth assessment of these issues, which should be of direct benefit to the projects themselves as well as the broader networking community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader goal of the NSF FIA effort is enhancing the relevance and impact of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership to the future of the Internet. FIA in general and the workshops in particular are a means to train a cohort of academic network researchers in the practice of long-range architectural thinking. FIA has the potential to contribute to a future Internet that is materially more secure, robust, economically viable, and fit for the needs of society than the Internet of today. The results of this workshop, posted on the FIA website (www.nets-fia.net) for public dissemination, are expected to provide a contribution to this broader goal.</AbstractNarration>
