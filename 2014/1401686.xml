    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry supports a project by Professor Lisa F. Szczepura from Illinois State University to examine the chemistry of carbene ligands bonded to multi-metal systems (clusters), and enhancing involvement of underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines at Illinois State. The proposed studies are critical to the future use of these clusters in applications such as catalysis. Professor Szczepura and students will develop new methods for these clusters containing stabilizing carbenes. In addition to developing new methods, there is an interest in determining the impact of these clusters in yielding novel light-emitting materials. In addition, Professor Szczepura will engage in training and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, running a STEM fair for underrepresented minorities on campus, and administering a program aimed at improving the success rate of underrepresented students in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic methodologies will be developed for the preparation of hexanuclear rhenium selenide and molybdenum chloride clusters containing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. The impact the NHCs have on the physical properties and small molecule activation of these cluster cores will be of primary interest. This award will also allow for an exploration into the viability of isolating supraoctahedral clusters containingthe more reactive Fischer and Schrock carbenes. Since the clusters with molybdenum and rhenium cores typically display interesting photophysical properties, the proposed research will enable these clusters to be adapted for applications such as sensors and luminescent materials.</AbstractNarration>
