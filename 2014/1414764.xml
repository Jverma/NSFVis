    <AbstractNarration>Random fluctuations (electromagnetic noise, heat, etc.) are everywhere, and they usually produce undesirable effects. However, if these random fluctuations are properly understood, systems can be designed to utilize noise in a positive manner. Many biological systems already utilize noise to improve performance. For example, sensory neurons in crayfish use noise to locate their prey, and ants exploit noise to optimize foraging. Engineers may look to these biological systems for inspiration. In this project, analytical, numerical, and experimental methods will be used to study the effects of noise on an oscillator array. This research will be performed at Kyoto University in Japan under the guidance of Dr. Takashi Hikihara, who is an internationally recognized figure in the area of nonlinear systems, with a well-cited body of work on oscillator arrays and energy localization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through previous research, tools have been developed to study oscillator arrays, notably the Method of Cumulants for the Fokker-Planck equation, as well as a finite elements scheme. However, it is not well understood how noise affects energy localizations in oscillator arrays. This project will allow comparison of two experimental arrangements of oscillator arrays, one of which is at the University of Maryland and another at Kyoto University. Some of the differences between the two experimental systems include the excitation direction, the nature of magnetic effects (passive versus electroactive), and the system configurations. By studying the same noise-influenced behavior through two different experiments, it might be possible to further "tune" parameters to exploit noise in novel ways. This research could develop novel ways for harnessing the energy of noise for constructive purposes, such as energy transportation through an array, the attenuation of undesirable energy localization, as well as for channeling communication signals. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
