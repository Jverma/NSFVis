    <AbstractNarration>SIMPLE- the Sub-ice Investigation of Marine and PLanetary Ecosystems, is a large, predominantly NASA-funded project that will explore the potential for the underside of Antarctica's ice shelves to support vibrant marine ecosystems, despite the constant darkness. A recently discovered "upside down" sea anemone from the underside of the ice was just named one of the top ten new species of 2013 in fact. Such systems could be an analog for life on distant, ice-covered planets and moons. The current award will support the hot-water drilling needed to allow a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to survey the underside of the ice during the upcoming Antarctic summer field season of 2014/2015. The award is supported as a RAPID because of the time-limited availability of specialized equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Nebraska at Lincoln has extensive experience with supporting hot-water drilling systems in Antarctica, and continued use of the UNL drillers helps maintain US expertise in this specialized skill. The NSF provided equipment, teamed with the NASA supported science, represents a synergistic federal partnership to support interesting science in a unique habitat, the underside of Antarctic ice shelves.</AbstractNarration>
