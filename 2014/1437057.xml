    <AbstractNarration>Fungi associated with plant roots play major ecological roles in nearly every terrestrial ecosystem, however, the factors that determine what species of mycorrhizal fungi are associated with a particular plant remain poorly understood. This project will test the hypothesis that the unique composition and low diversity of fungi associated with plants in the genus Alnus are driven by the presence of nitrogen-fixing Frankia bacteria. The research will involve field, lab, and culture-based experiments that utilize a range of molecular and biochemical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By focusing on the enzymatic capacities of ectomycorrhizal fungi as well as their growth in different nutrient settings, the research will explicitly examine the relative importance of host-plant selection and environment conditions in the structuring of mycorrhizal assemblages. There has been a strong temperate bias in ecological studies of mycorrhizal fungi, and proposed research in Mexico will reveal whether patterns observed in temperate areas are also present in a tropical region. More broadly, this research will highlight the importance of understanding symbioses in their ecological context, where multiple simultaneous interactions can significantly influence individual pair-wise outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build both scientific infrastructure and education. The combination of field and lab-based analyses will expose a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate research assistants to a wide range of research techniques. Direct collaboration with investigators in France and Mexico will provide excellent opportunities for scientific and cultural exchange. Finally, the proposal will involve a collaboration with a high school biology teacher, which will result in a teaching module about plant-microbial symbioses and their importance in Pacific Northwest, USA forests.</AbstractNarration>
