    <AbstractNarration>With rapid changes and new developments in nanotechnology, bioscience, corrosion, and green technologies, as well as in more traditional areas of metals, plastics and composites, industry need for qualified and educated technicians who understand the basics of materials technology has grown. As such, it is imperative that educational and training programs keep abreast of these advances and have a resource to identify and articulate the linkages between materials science and manufacturing processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education (MatEdU) (www.materialseducation.org) strives to be the focal point where industry, education and community collaborate to meet the materials technology workforce needs. MatEdU partners with high schools, community and technical colleges, and universities, including official partnerships with sixteen 2-year and 4-year institutions, and over thirty-five other collaborators. MatEdU is contributing to the body of knowledge in material science by providing instructional resources, up-to-date core competencies, faculty professional development workshops, and technician education to meet the skill demands of employers. These efforts are especially important as new materials and processes continue to emerge. The expanded use of technology is enabling MatEdU to have broader reach, including to underrepresented populations. Enhanced dissemination of MatEdU products to professional societies, industries, educational institutions, and community organizations is impacting the numbers of educated technicians prepared to enter the workforce in this field that is crucial to U.S. global competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>
