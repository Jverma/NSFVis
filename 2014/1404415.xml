    <AbstractNarration>This project funds travel support for academic participation in a workshop organized by the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Subcommittee's Large Scale Networking (LSN) Coordinating Group, and co-sponsored by NSF and DoE, on issues associated with the national deployment of an inter-carrier Software Defined Networking (SDN) service. The workshop will be held at NSF on December 17th and 18th, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the workshop is to explore the steps to an operational prototype SDN network and to identify the required longer term research. Specific goals also include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Identifying current capabilities and resources that contribute to development and operation of an SDN prototype network that interoperates seamlessly with the current public Internet&lt;br/&gt;2. Identifying research, resource, and collaboration needs in creating such a system&lt;br/&gt;3. Identifying gaps in operational software tools necessary for running a production, multidomain SDN network&lt;br/&gt;4. Identifying opportunities for SDN virtualized networks to interact with 'clouds' of computation and storage&lt;br/&gt;5. Providing a workshop report to NSF and the other NITRD agencies on needed research and development, resources and collaboration for the prototype system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SDN is a key emerging technology and is being used to support a number of national priority programs. Developing a sound basis for inter-carrier SDN will enable the widespread deployment of applications using SDN.</AbstractNarration>
