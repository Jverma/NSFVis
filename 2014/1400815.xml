    <AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wisconsin Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WiscAMP), led by the University of Wisconsin(UW)-Madison, consists of 13 four-year UW campuses (Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse, Madison, Milwaukee, Oshkosh, Parkside, Platteville, River Falls, Stevens Point, Stout, Superior and Whitewater); 4 private (not for profit) schools (Alverno College, Beloit College, Lawrence University and the Milwaukee School of Engineering); and 2 two-year institutions (Madison Area Technical College (Madison College) and UW-Rock County, 1 of 13 UW-College campuses managed as a single institution in the UW-System). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a senior alliance, WiscAMP capitalizes on its momentum toward achieving the twin goals of broadening participation in advanced STEM degree career pathways and transforming WiscAMP institutions to support and sustain diversity across and throughout the alliance through the following program objectives: (1) doubling the current number of URM students who graduate with STEM baccalaureate degrees, (2) doubling the current number of WiscAMP students who enter STEM graduate programs, and (3) tripling the number of STEM faculty in the alliance who adopt evidence-based broadening participation practices in their research mentoring and/or classroom instruction. Undergraduate students, including community college students, participate in STEM recruitment and retention interventions such as faculty-mentored undergraduate research, graduate school preparation, summer research experiences, including international experiences abroad as appropriate. Faculty are involved in producing evidenced-based broadening participation research to increase the body of knowledge in retaining underrepresented minority students in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
