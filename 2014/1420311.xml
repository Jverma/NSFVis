    <AbstractNarration>Although organizational reform is often communicated from the top-down, responsibility for EBP implementation generally falls heavily on street-level workers, like probation officers (POs) as they implement policy and practice changes by incorporating them into workplace routines and decisions. Many justice organizations, including state probation agencies, now encourage managers and staff to adopt evidence-based practices (EBPs)--practices shown through scientific evidence to improve individual and system level outcomes. For example, some practices can reduce recidivism. In probation, EBPs focus on rehabilative practices such as validated assessments, motivational interviewing, and cognitive-behavioral therapies. EBP implementation requires justice organizations to adopt new protocols and change daily work practices. The potential for EBPs to improve probation practice and better serve communities depends upon how street-level workers handle EBPs. Street-level workers are front-line policy interpreters with primary responsibility for policy implementation. Following this framework, other scholars have noted the prevalence of discretionary decision making within street-level work that affects new policy interpretation and implementation. This study examines: 1) how POs understand, define and adapt EBPs to their existing organizational routines; 2) the conditions under which POs make adaptations to EBPs during implementation, and 3) the role organizational culture and institutional history play in shaping adaptation decisions, which influences PO practices and outcomes. This project will provide data and analysis to further our understanding of complex decision making processes surrounding the use of new practices and how historical and cultural influences shape street-level decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will also contribute to providing insight for agencies about how to move away from relying on ineffective or inadequate treatment and services for offender populations and towards use of best available practices to improve supervision strategies that will, in turn, improve offender outcomes and public safety. Given the widespread interest in EBPs, the project will contribute to better policymaking concerning probation.</AbstractNarration>
