    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the discovery of nanolithographically, surface-patterned, liquid separations membranes (NIL-membranes) to fill the need for high performance, industrial separations. The project will result in a proof-of-concept for the manufacturing scalability of NIL-membranes. A NIL-membrane has the unique feature of regular, submicron surface patterns, which are mechanically embossed on existing commercial membranes, while retaining the original membranes' permselective separation properties. These features provide the advantages of higher energy efficiency, lower operating costs, and no chemical waste generation when compared to the leading competing approach of chemically modifying the membrane's surface. This project addresses the scale-up technology gap(s) required to translate the research discovery toward commercial application. In particular, the fabrication and use of flexible, low cost, polymeric patterning molds for manufacturing NIL-membranes?using continuous, pressure and temperature application required for industrial manufacturing equipment?has never been studied or demonstrated. The project will conduct proof-of-concept research and development (on a 6" pilot scale) to fabricate flexible patterning films; use those films in a pinch roll embossing process to fabricate larger-sized NIL-membranes; and evaluate these prototype membranes for specific industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project partners with the Innovation Center of the Rockies and Water Think Tank, LLC to guide commercialization aspects. Additionally, a number of other food and membrane companies have been actively engaged with the research as stakeholders to augment testing the larger membranes to be produced in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIL-membrane platform is important because synthetic membranes are broadly used in water, food, biopharma, petrochemical, fossil and renewable energy, microelectronics, medical, and other consumer-oriented industries to perform "filtration" with varying degrees of "fineness" and complexity. Productivity enhancements from the NIL-membranes will lower costs, save energy, and lessen environmental impacts, thus accelerating the benefits of membrane-based processes across areas such as, water supply and reuse, food and energy production, and biomedicine manufacture. In addition, the potential economic impact is expected to be $40M/y in the next 5 years (and grow 7-8%/y thereafter), which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the global membrane supply market space.</AbstractNarration>
