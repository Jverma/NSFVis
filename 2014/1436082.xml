    <AbstractNarration>CBET 1436082&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use numerical methods and computer simulation to examine blood flow in the vascular system and in extracorporeal channels, including microfluidic devices that process blood for diagnostic purposes. The project will focus on analyzing and predicting the migration of cells during flow. Red blood cells tend to migrate toward the center of a vessel or channel, while white blood cells and platelets are displaced toward vessel or channel walls. The project will investigate how cell migration is affected by the geometry of the vessel cross-section, hematocrit, flow rate through the vessel, and interactions among the cells. In addition, the proposal will consider the effects of small amount of polymers added to the blood. These polymers are known to reduce energy losses in turbulent flow, but recent evidence suggests they may also affect laminar blood flow in ways that have physiological benefits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A computational and mathematical framework will be developed for predicting migration of blood cells during flow through a vessel. Red blood cell margination and the formation of cell free layers at the vessel walls will be examined for flow geometries characteristic of the circulation and microfluidic devices. The role of long-chain drag reducing polymers will be examined to resolve the mechanism by which they affect margination and the development of a cell free layer. The results of the computer simulations will be compared with experiments carried out by the investigator?s colleagues. The results will improve our understanding of the biomechanical aspects of various hematological disorders.</AbstractNarration>
