    <AbstractNarration>Vacuum processes are integral to research in nanoscience, medical device development, and advanced physics as well as advanced manufacturing of products such as hybrid cars, computers, flat screen televisions, and solar panels. In spite of vacuum technology's ubiquitous presence, the numbers of technicians needed in any given region is relatively small and the post-secondary education options for this specialized field are rare. This project will develop a cost-effective program that can provide geographically dispersed businesses and research institutions with highly-skilled technicians in this critical technology via a combination of distance education and hands-on instruction. Normandale Community College will partner with businesses and two- and four-year institutions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York to expand the reach of its certificate and associate degree programs in vacuum technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will 1) pilot the delivery of a distance education model that combines high-definition telepresence technology with hands-on instruction using a mobile, fully-functional vacuum trainer system; 2) validate the competencies required by industries that rely on vacuum technology and develop assessments to measure learner mastery of concepts; and 3) revise, as needed, the vacuum technology curriculum and vacuum trainer system to provide rigorous academic and hands-on learning aligned with industry needs and incorporate a modular structure to facilitate flexible options for customized training and regional customization based on dominant industry sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance knowledge of equipment maintenance technician occupations, specifically those who service vacuum systems, and their education. It fills a gap in the continuum of education and training for technicians able to support and maintain vacuum systems by providing smaller markets with access to technician education.</AbstractNarration>
