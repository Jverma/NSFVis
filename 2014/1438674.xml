    <AbstractNarration>This is a request to support participation of U.S.-based graduate students who are presenting papers at the 20th International Union of Soil Sciences World Congress in Jeju, South Korea, during June 8-13, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those supported by the fellowships will benefit by interacting with leading persons in their field of research and discussing their work with them. Their involvement in the congress will expose them to new areas of research and keep them engaged in the field, helping to build the future academic infrastructure. The fellowship program will enable those who might not otherwise&lt;br/&gt;be able to attend the congress to do so, encouraging the participation of the strongest U.S. soil science research talent at this meeting.</AbstractNarration>
