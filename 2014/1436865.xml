    <AbstractNarration>SAR11 (Pelagibacterales) are the most abundant group of bacterioplankton in the oceans. Globally, they are estimated to oxidize to carbon dioxide (CO2) between 5 and 22% of all the organic carbon produced by photosynthesis each day. The activities of bacterioplankton such as SAR11 determine the residence times of different forms of organic carbon, and ultimately shape the composition of dissolved organic pools in the oceans, which rival atmospheric CO2 in mass. Accurate and detailed information about the oceanic carbon cycle is used in models that are valued for their potential to predict and understand future changes in ocean ecosystems. This grant supports analyses of genomic data that predict the carbon oxidation functions of SAR11 cells, and supports experiments with cells in culture, where high-resolution mass spectrometry technology is applied to discover new organic carbon oxidation biochemistry. To assess the importance of SAR11 carbon oxidation functions in ocean ecosystems, this project includes four short oceanographic cruises to the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, in the western Sargasso Sea. On these cruises the concentrations and oxidation rates of organic compounds will be measured, and linked to variation in planktonic SAR11 populations. This grant also supports teacher professional development training on the topic of Carbon Cycling by Marine Microorganisms, in Oregon State University's Science &amp; Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) program. This program prepares minority, low-income, historically underrepresented, and other educationally underserved students from rural areas to graduate from high school, enroll and succeed in higher education, and pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a paradox that SAR11 cells are the most abundant in the oceans, but also have among the smallest genomes known. The central goal of this proposal is to understand what types of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are oxidized to CO2 by SAR11. Implicit to this approach is the perspective that some abundant chemoheterotrophic bacterioplankton taxa, particularly those with small genomes, have evolved specialist strategies for oxidizing organic matter. Understanding these strategies can lead to a more detailed and accurate understanding of the biological processes that recycle biological production to CO2. Major project aims are: 1) investigate SAR11 genomes and assay cells in culture with high-resolution mass spectrometry approaches and isotopic labeling to identify the range of compounds these cells can oxidize to CO2; 2) at BATS, measure biological oxidation rates of DOM compounds used by SAR11; 3) link spatiotemporal SAR11 genome variation to patterns of DOM oxidation in the ocean surface layer (0-300 m). This projects includes four short cruises to BATS that target the four microbial plankton community types at this site: upper euphotic zone, deep chlorophyll maximum, spring bloom and upper mesopelagic. Products of this activity will include new information about variation in labile DOM oxidation across the surface layer, and specific links to genome features that will improve the accuracy of interpretation of global ocean metagenomic data.</AbstractNarration>
