    <AbstractNarration>Ultra low frequency (ULF) waves are important for the transport of energy in the near-Earth magnetosphere. This research will improve a MHD wave code and apply it to several problems involving ULF waves in the magnetosphere. The outcome will be a global ULF wave model that can address the specific science questions in this proposal and provide an approach that can be applied to many other problems in magnetospheric physics. Specifically the proposal will address three questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. The propagation and dynamics of ULF waves in the inner magnetosphere, to understand the dynamics of the Pi1 and Pi2 pulsations found at substorm onset and their timing at both high and mid-latitudes with respect to driving sources in the magnetotail.&lt;br/&gt;2. The use of ULF waves to determine the mass density of the magnetosphere through travel-time and field-line resonance ?magnetoseismology?. &lt;br/&gt;3. The coupling of high and low-latitude wave fields through the propagation of MHD waves through the magnetosphere and of electromagnetic waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. &lt;br/&gt;This research will support a graduate student. The wave model will be very useful in other magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling studies. This model provides a missing link in our global models of magnetosphere and ionosphere coupling and therefore is important for space weather. As result it has high societal value.</AbstractNarration>
