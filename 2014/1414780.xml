    <AbstractNarration>This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) for approximately 12 graduate students, along with a panel of 3 distinguished research faculty mentors. The event will take place in conjunction with the 2014 International Conference on Supporting Groupwork (GROUP 2014), to be held November 9-12 on Sanibel Island, Florida, and sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI). For over 25 years, the bi-annual GROUP conferences have been a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice on organizational behavior, information systems, social informatics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), providing a showcase for innovative work on the development, introduction, management, deployment, and analysis of computer-based collaborative systems. A strong emphasis of the GROUP conferences is to foster discourse on collaborative technology that bridges the fields of CSCW, information systems, technology enhanced learning, and learning at the workplace; relevant issues include the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and impact of these systems, as well as examinations of relevant research methodologies. Research reports published in the GROUP conference proceedings are competitively reviewed and widely cited. More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.acm.org/conferences/group/conferences/group14/. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GROUP 2014 Doctoral Consortium (DC) will be a research-focused day-long meeting on Sunday, November 9, with follow-up events that take place during the conference's main technical program. Student participants will be later stage doctoral students from both the United States and abroad, who represent the various disciplines and subfields of interest to the conference. The goals of the workshop are to build a cohort group of young researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread across the world, to guide and shape the work of the new researchers by having experts serve as mentors and give advice, to provide encouragement and support for the selection of GROUP research topics, to make it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend a leading research conference and to illustrate for them the interrelationship and diversity of GROUP research, and in general to make the new entrants' experience at the GROUP conference enjoyable and rewarding, so that they will be encouraged to return and submit to future conferences in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The GROUP conferences represent a critical link between the research communities supported by CISE/IIS and the broader social, behavioral, and management sciences. Maintaining and fostering research dialog among these diverse disciplines will result in synergistic and transformative research collaborations. Further, developing young researchers who can effectively bridge two or more of the broader CISE/IIS, social and management sciences is an important goal to ensure the future vitality of the IIS research community. The GROUP 2014 DC will bring together the best of the next generation of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and CSCW researchers. The social network among this next generation of researchers, and the relationships with senior researchers, created by the workshop will play a critical role in their enculturation into the profession. The organizers will be proactive in order to ensure that both students and faculty are a diverse group across multiple dimensions including nationality, scientific discipline, gender, institutional affiliation, and under-represented minority status. To further ensure diversity, no more than 2 student participants will be accepted from any one institution.</AbstractNarration>
