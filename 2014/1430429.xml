    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to secure travel support for 15 promising, young U.S. scientists to attend the 16th International Congress on Plant-Microbe Interactions (IC-MPMI), which will convene in Rhodes, Greece from July 6-10, 2014. This meeting is the premier forum for announcing and discussing the most innovative scientific discoveries elucidating the molecular events by which plants and microbe interact. The program will include established and young scientists working on pathogenic and symbiotic associations using diverse biological systems. Plenary and concurrent sessions will highlight the latest advances in fundamental research as well as translational studies critical for advancements in agricultural science. A major goal of the IC-MPMI is to provide an interactive platform to share emerging data, establish and strengthen collaborations, and develop innovative strategies and technology to improve plant health, productivity, and security. These activities require full participation from the international scientific community, most notably U.S. students in training (i.e. graduate students and post-doctoral scholars). Travel fellowship awardees will participate in small workshops and lunches with established international scientists to promote student participation and critical discussion. Awardees will contribute to the dissemination of findings by releasing meeting highlights via social networking and publishing a congress report. The broader impact of the IC-MPMI is to unite specialists who otherwise would not cross paths. The meeting provides significant training value for young U.S. scientists, including enhanced learning, networking, and career development at the international level. The organizers have promoted broader participation of minorities, women, and first-generation students by identifying top candidates at U.S. institutions and soliciting their applications for the meeting travel fellowships. Importantly, advanced professional development of young U.S. scientists in plant-microbe interactions is fundamental to ensure sustained production of high-quality crops in the U.S., and to meet the increasing demands for food and energy worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
