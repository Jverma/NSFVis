    <AbstractNarration>The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China is one of the largest reservoir systems in the world. Environmental concerns of the TGR construction and operation, such as nutrient enrichment of reservoir waters, algal blooms, fragmentation of critical habitats, and greenhouse gas emissions (methane and carbon dioxide) from the reservoir area, have drawn global concern. Studies of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production from the TGR and other large reservoirs worldwide has demonstrated that hydroelectric power is not a carbon-neutral energy source. However, more rigorous methods of estimating reservoir carbon emissions are still necessary. In collaboration with Dr. Zhe Li, a noted expert on reservoir biogeochemistry at Chongqing University, this project will use statistical and geospatial tools to analyze data from ongoing monitoring of CH4 and CO2 fluxes, water quality, and reservoir characteristics to provide a comprehensive estimate of both CH4 and CO2 emissions for the TGR. The approach developed in this project will help to estimate CH4 and CO2 emissions for other reservoir systems around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use statistical and geospatial tools to create a spatially-heterogeneous estimate of CH4 and CO2 emissions from the TGR. The proposed work will integrate geospatial analysis into a long-term study of reservoir carbon fluxes. Multivariate statistics and geospatial tools in ArcGIS will be utilized to determine spatially-heterogeneous relationships between reservoir properties - such as depth and nutrient levels - and carbon emissions. The approach developed in this project can be used to predict how greenhouse gas emissions may change in the TGR under various management regimes, and will be applied to other reservoir systems. Overall, this project will help to advance the current methods of estimating greenhouse gas emissions from reservoir systems and can aid in understanding the carbon budget of freshwater systems. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
