    <AbstractNarration>When the first stars in the history of the universe were formed, they began to emit light, known as photons. It is believed that this light can be observed as a faint glow that is seen in every direction in the sky using infrared telescopes. Measuring this faint glow, referred to as the Cosmic Near-Infrared Background (NIRB), can be thought of as indirectly looking at the first sources of light. Professor Kyung-jin Ahn at Chosun University in Gwangju, South Korea, has recently run a high-resolution cosmological simulation that captures the formation of the first sources of light. Using these simulations, the connections between the properties of the first sources and their surroundings and the observed NIRB will be made. This research will study the correlation between the first sources of light and the NIRB. In studying this correlation, a better understanding about the history of the universe can be gained. Studying the universe will provide tests for physics that cannot be studied through experimentation on Earth, thereby leading to further advancements in human knowledge and technological developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this dataset, the resulting spectrum will be calculated, which can then be compared with the actual observations. Furthermore, because certain factors, such as star formation rates, the number of photons produced, and the initial mass function, are known in advance, precisely how these parameters manifest themselves in the NIRB can be understood. Putting a tighter limit on these parameters will also lead to a better understanding of a different astrophysical event, Cosmic Reionization, when the universe transformed from being filled with neutral hydrogen to a sea of ionized plasma. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>
