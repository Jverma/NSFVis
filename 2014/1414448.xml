    <AbstractNarration>The mechanical pipette is one of the most commonly used hand tools in the laboratory. Since laboratory workers perform repetitive pipetting which requires careful and precise control, it can cause discomfort, pain, or other musculoskeletal injuries. This research will investigate the mechanics of thumb movement when using a pipette to better understand, and ultimately prevent, laboratory worker injuries. Specifically this project will focus on better understanding control and measurement equipment for experiments on thumb movement mechanics and on developing a cadaver hand simulator and Thumb Finger Force Measurement system. The cadaver hand simulator will be developed in collaboration with Dr. Yong-Ku Kong, a noted expert on biomechanical hand models and cadaver experiments, at Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, Korea. This study will help in designing a efficient hand grip that will reduce the risk of injuries while holding tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two objectives in this research. First, the biomechanics in the thumb for a pipetting will be observed through cadaver experiments in order to see how the ratio of tendon forces connected to the thumb impacts external thumb motion and force. Second, a biomechanical thumb model will be developed to evaluate grips when using hand tools and provide a practical guideline for designing them. The result of this study is expected to benefit society in two ways. First, it will contribute to improving the wellness of individuals. The prevention of occupational injuries is investigated and findings are expected to contribute to improved worker safety and health. Second, the study could help strengthen the economic competitiveness of the United States. Since workplace injuries result in economic losses to a company, this study is expected to increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry by reducing these economic losses. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>
