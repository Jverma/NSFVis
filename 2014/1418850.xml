    <AbstractNarration>Women are underrepresented in science and technology within research and academic institutions.&lt;br/&gt;Women of the STEM diaspora within the U.S. represent an important element in bringing more women into STEM fields as role models, mentors and peers. This proposed workshop builds on two previous general sessions on the diaspora and focuses the outcome on research collaborations and targeted proposals. The synthesis model is designed to quickly form teams among participants and is outcome focused throughout the workshop session. In addition, the workshop builds on the International Gender Summit (hosted by NSF in 2013) and the Global Diaspora Forum (hosted by U.S. State Department in 2013). Both venues have provided collaborative opportunities for women of the STEM diaspora and it is anticipated that most of the participants will be identified from these two summits. Graduate students and early career women from the diaspora and women of color will be invited to attend the workshop and meet with academic and researchers from the STEM diaspora. Organizers will also use networking survey tools and assessments to explore network characteristics of women in the workshop and use social media tools to follow participants post-workshop and to maintain network connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mobilizing Women of the STEM Diaspora (MW-STEM) workshop has two goals: (1) build global network on women of the STEM diaspora, and (2) provide peer-to-peer and institution-to-institutional mentoring in the development of scientific collaborations. MW-STEM will be hosted in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago, February 2014 and will be co-hosted by the U.S. State Department and AAAS Fellows. The proposed workshop will provide a space where the participants work to a common outcome using facilitated breakout sessions. The MW-STEM agenda is designed around creating teams that first organize around general topic themes: (1) research collaborations; (2) peer mentoring networks; (3) theme and proposal development towards 2014 and 2015 Gender Summits; and (4) white paper/review authorship. Workshop products will be disseminated through (1) proposal development and submission; (2) published review paper on identified issues for women of the STEM diaspora; (3) peer mentoring networks established through LinkedIn and other social media.</AbstractNarration>
