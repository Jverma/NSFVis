    <AbstractNarration>Combinatorics is a growing and important area of mathematics. The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to continuous) sets of objects. Combinatorics is critical to many areas of mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering applications. In part due to the legacy of Paul Erdos, combinatorics is a research field driven by collaboration. In order to provide graduate students in combinatorics a collaborative research opportunity and nurture long-lasting research collaborations, we will organize the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Workshop Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Workshop Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC), which will be held in Denver, CO from July 28th-August 8th, 2014, will involve approximately 30 graduate students, 4 postdoctoral researchers and 10 faculty in an intense two-week collaborative research experience. Participants will work to solve important, relevant problems from graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial matrix theory, finite geometry and other modern sub-disciplines of combinatorics. Students will prepare open problems prior to the workshop under the guidance of a faculty mentor from the organizing committee, which consists of faculty from the University of Colorado Denver, University of Denver, Iowa State University, the University of Wyoming and the University of Nebraska Lincoln. These problems will then either be presented at the workshop by their proposers or hosted on the workshop's secure problem wiki, and will be worked on by small groups of participating students, postdocs and faculty.
