    <AbstractNarration>The main motivation and goal for the proposed research project is to provide new techniques that assist law enforcement address the rise in crimes involving mobile devices, particularly tackle the difficulty of tracking down a mobile device in a loosely controlled wireless environment. Previous research results have demonstrated good outcomes. With the support of I-Corps funding, the team believes that the proposed system will be examined and integrated by a large body of related government agencies, industrial institutions, and digital forensics companies, thereby having a great impact on improving public safety in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to establish an infrastructure-free security monitoring and tracking system for wireless targets ( iSMoWT) that focuses on identifying the location of a target mobile device with pieces of information gathered by collaborative wireless monitoring devices in a WiFi network. The iSMoWT system differs from other existing mobile device localization systems in that iSMoWT provides a way to track a target mobile device rather than perform self-localization based on the GPS and location sensors built in a device itself. Further, iSMoWT does not rely on the data gathered at pre-deployed wireless infrastructure nodes such as WiFi Access Points and the Base-stations of cellphone carriers. In this I-Corps project, the team is also interested in exploring other potential application fields for iSMoWT, such as health care systems and wireless network performance management systems.</AbstractNarration>
