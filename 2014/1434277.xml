    <AbstractNarration>1434277&lt;br/&gt;Huang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this exploratory project, the PI proposes to develop a novel methodology for strategic-tactical control of industrial sustainability by building on sustainability fundamentals, system control science, uncertainty theory, and engineering science. The study aims at providing scientific answers to three questions: (i) why and what kind of industrial problems should be tackled as a sustainability control theory problem, (ii) what kind of sustainability control system should be synthesized and how to do so, and (iii) how to derive decisions for sustainable development (SD) of industrial systems under uncertainty? The study includes: (i) a predictive input-output modeling method, (ii) an interval-parameter-based system and technology assessment method,(iii) a multistage, hierarchical decision-making method, and (iv) a method for designing a hierarchical sustainability control system. These methods will be tested through studying a complex manufacturing sustainability problem. The proposed research is radically different from traditional studies on engineering sustainability. If successful, this exploratory research could be transformative as this study will introduce the new concept of "sustainability control," and may result in the creation of a new paradigm for sustainability study and introduce a new branch in engineering, which could be called "sustainability control science." This may be the first attempt to formulate complex sustainability problems as a hierarchical control problem, which may improve significantly our understanding of SD concept and practice. This study may be also the earliest to introduce an integrated SD methodology encompassing system modeling, assessment, and decision making for strategic-tactical control under uncertainty. The research is aimed at contributing greatly to the field through improving scientific understanding of industrial sustainability and providing a holistic methodology for tackling complex sustainability problems. The project will generate educational materials (i.e., lecture materials and open-ended team projects) for enhancing an chemical engineering senior design course and an introductory course on sustainable engineering open to all engineering students. The methodology will be disseminated through publication and the AIChE Sustainable Engineering Forum. Short courses will be arranged with chemical industries.</AbstractNarration>
