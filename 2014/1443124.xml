    <AbstractNarration>1443124&lt;br/&gt;Harmer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for US Participants at the 2014 Gordon Research Conference in Green Chemistry, July 27-August 1, to be held in Hong Kong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the registration and/or travel for US participants to exchange new science and technology ideas at the 2014 Green Chemistry Gordon Research Conference (July 27-August 1) and the 2014 Green Chemistry Gordon Research Seminar (July 26-27) to be held in Hong Kong. These meetings will bring together an outstanding and diverse group of scientists who will present their latest research and the most important advances relevant to Industrial Green Chemistry. The students and postdocs will have the opportunity to exchange expertise/ideas among themselves across a broad range of green areas, approaches and methods. This conference addresses many issues that impact the World today from Green Energy, Bioprocessing to new types of Green polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Green Chemistry Gordon Research Conference focuses on the cutting-edge developments required to design chemical products and processes that: have a smaller environmental impact, both in their manufacture and use; are produced in an energy-efficient manner with the least possible intrinsic hazards; and have been designed for inherent safety for human health and the environment. A highly distinguished group of invited speakers will present their unpublished research on designing greener chemicals, greener processes, Green Energy, biopolymers, new organic approaches to pharmaceuticals, life cycle analysis and green chemistry education. The Green Chemistry GRC/GRS are particularly important and timely because the outputs of Green Chemistry research are now driving innovation in both academia and industry and are proving to be key measures of competitiveness in major industries.</AbstractNarration>
