    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate interfering cellular networks, which are networks formed by operating multiple cells of a traditional cellular network over the same frequency. In particular, it will develop efficient communication schemes for such networks that (a) deal with interfering data flows between multiple source-destination pairs (b) include cooperative strategies between nodes to exploit resources such as a wired back bone of constrained capacity and connectivity between access points and (c) robustly cope with channel uncertainty. Throughout, approximated capacity characterizations or those that are amenable to computation will be sought, with an emphasis on methods that scale well to a larger number of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to develop improved alternatives to communication methods employed in current cellular networks. The importance of such improved methods in the design of future generations of these networks is evident from the e-commerce that such networks enable, the information they make easily accessible and the increased efficiency of organizations they make possible today.</AbstractNarration>
