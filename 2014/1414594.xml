    <AbstractNarration>Learning a second language is crucial to interacting in today's global world. Much of the difficulty in acquiring a second language is in learning its sound system. Failure to learn the sound system can lead to incorrect word representations, word representations being made up of smaller sound units: for example, the sounds d, ah, g make the word dog. Understanding what can make words containing foreign sounds easier to learn is important for developing better methods of teaching a second language. Many studies suggest that hearing words produced by multiple talkers helps infants and young children to develop more robust word representations. Multiple talkers may also help second language learners, who are likewise inexperienced with the language's sound system. However, second language learners may not benefit from multiple talkers in all circumstances. In collaboration with Dr. Jane Tsay at National Chung Chen University in Taiwan, this project will explore the circumstances in which multiple talkers are beneficial for second language learners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from a behavioral experiment at the Psycholinguistic Lab at Chung Cheng National University will shed light on the question of why multiple talkers are helpful for forming a robust word representation. It will also speak to the long-standing question: to what extent is perceiving speech related to producing speech? Based on the PI's previous studies, it is hypothesized that when perceiving new words, experienced learners will not benefit from multiple talkers, while inexperienced learners will. In contrast, it is hypothesized that even experienced learners will continue to benefit from multiple talkers when producing new words, although they will cease to benefit when perceiving new words. Such a result would suggest that speakers use different word representations for perceiving vs. producing words. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>
