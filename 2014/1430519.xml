    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) research groups in Nebraska and Kansas will form a collaborative consortium to study and develop ways to control fundamental processes of electron motion in atoms, molecules, and nanostructures that occur at ultrafast (femto (10-15) to atto (10-18) second) time scales. The project will bring together experimental and theoretical physicists, chemists and electrical engineers from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln (UNL), the Kansas State University (KSU), and the University of Kansas (KU) as well as the facilities for AMO research at the James R. Macdonald Laboratory (JRML) at KSU, Extreme Light Laboratory at UNL, Physics and Chemistry departments at KU, and the computing resources at the partner institutions to explore novel states of matter. The project team plans to engage in synergistic activities to expand and diversify the STEM workforce by engaging students, teachers, and researchers at broad ranging educational levels. Research and educational collaborations among the consortium partners as well as at national and international levels and the preparation of a diverse, globally engaged STEM workforce training are expected to be sustained beyond the award period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;The projects will use femto to atto second pulses of light to trigger different types of reactions in matter and use pump-probe measurements, high harmonic generation, and ultrafast electron diffraction methods to study and image atomic and molecular motions. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies will be carried out to understand the molecular ionization processes caused by the interaction of strong laser fields and molecules. Participating researchers will build an electron spectrometer with angular resolution, improve the accuracy of extracting the molecular structure parameters, and establish an improved ionization theory for polyatomic molecules. Another aspect of the project will focus on experimental and theoretical studies to investigate the interaction of nanostructures to ultrashort pulses of extreme ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Applications such as ultrafast optical free electron beam switches will also be explored. The project will leverage the infrastructure and education, diversity, and outreach programs established by Kansas and Nebraska Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to engage and inspire students at all levels. During the three years of this Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 project, the program expects to provide 19 person-years of postdoctoral training and support 48 graduate students, 18 undergraduates and 18 faculty members from two-and four-year colleges, 18 high school students, and 30 high school teachers in research.</AbstractNarration>
