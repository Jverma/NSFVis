    <AbstractNarration>The 29th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications will be held July 23 - 26, 2014 at the College of Staten Island, City University of New York. Motivated by many examples from the real world, topology is a mathematical field that aims to study the shape of a space. It often requires the use of tools from other mathematical fields, giving rise to various subfields in topology. The main goal of the conference is to bring together a group of the world's leading researchers in these subfields and to provide a single forum for a comprehensive meeting, which will promote cross-fertilization of research directions and methods across several disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invited contributed talks will be presented in the six special sessions: (1) Asymmetry and its Applications, (2) Continua with Applications, (3) Foliations, Laminations, and Attractors, (4) Geometric Topology, (5) Set-theoretic and General Topology, and (6) Topology in Functional Analysis. Each special session features one plenary speaker, one semi-plenary speaker and 20 to 25 other contributed presentations. In addition to the special sessions, the conference includes two workshops for graduate students and other interested participants. Participation by women and members of other underrepresented groups is encouraged and supported. Graduate students and young topologists will receive substantial financial support to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: https://csivc.csi.cuny.edu/SumTopo2014</AbstractNarration>
