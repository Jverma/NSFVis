    <AbstractNarration>The 21st century will see huge demographic movements and cultural shifts caused by a global increase in the elderly population. The prevalence of Web applications appears to be growing in parallel with this increase in life expectancy. It is believed that people over 60 today constitute one of the fastest growing groups of Web users. Unfortunately, aging users face many challenges when trying to access the Internet due to declines in vision, hearing, mobility and cognitive abilities. This project will focus on developing a set of accessible Web-based exercises that aim at improving cognitive well-being of elderly Japanese adults. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Chieko Asakawa, IBM Fellow and Group Leader of the Accessibility Research Group of IBM Research in Tokyo, Japan. As an Accessibility Designer, Dr. Asakawa focuses on aiding web developers and designers create more universally accessible content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project serves two purposes: 1) to gather information about the accessibility barriers faced by older Japanese Web users by observing their Web interaction, and 2) to carefully design Web-based brain-training software capable of improving the cognitive well-being of the same target population. An investigation into the current accessibility and usability issues experienced by older Japanese persons with Web applications will be conducted through interviews and focus group discussions. A low-fidelity prototype will be developed and tested via a cognitive walkthrough with users to measure user engagement and acceptance. A high-fidelity prototype through the desired Web interface will be developed and accumulated user data will be used to adapt the system for specific and individualized use with elderly Japanese persons. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
