    <AbstractNarration>Modern high-performance computers have many different processors that must work together to complete incoming tasks. These processors cannot communicate efficiently, may run at different speeds, and can break down without warning. This research will implement a new method that allows multiple, unreliable processors to complete tasks without communicating with each other directly. The processors have no prior knowledge of when the tasks will arrive, and must handle them as they come. Dividing work in this setting is a fundamental task in high-performance computing, and this research has the potential to improve performance of real systems. This work will be conducted at the National University of Singapore in collaboration with Professor Seth Gilbert, one of the inventors of this method that will provide invaluable assistance in implementation of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This data structure, the dynamic to-do tree, is the first task mapping data structure for asynchronous processors and online tasks that achieves theoretical guarantees (within log3 m of optimal where m is the maximum number of concurrent tasks). The goal will be to verify that the dynamic to-do tree also achieves good practical performance. This data structure will be compared with the current state of the art, hopefully showing a significant improvement. These results may have broader implications for less restricted versions of the problem (i.e. the tasks are given offline) and to other similar tasks such as mutual exclusion and distributed clocks. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>
