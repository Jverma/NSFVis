    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the second in a series of international conferences on Physics coming out of, or relevant to, the Large Hadron Collider. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. The LHC accelerates beams of protons (a type of particle known as a hadron) to the highest energies currently attainable in the world. By colliding these beams, the LHC can create particles that were present in the early universe, such as the Higgs Boson which was discovered in 2012 by the two large experiments at CERN, ATLAS and CMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LHCP conference series highlights experimental results from the LHC and Tevatron collider (at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory) experiments along with related theoretical developments. The conference will be held at Columbia University. The conference program will be devoted to a review of the latest experimental and theoretical results on hadron collider physics and a discussion on the outlook for the coming years. The conference intends to provide a forum for lively discussions between experimenters and theorists on topics such as the Standard Model Physics and Beyond, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetry and Heavy Ion Physics. Planning for the LHC high luminosity upgrades is also included. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the attendance of 100 students to the LHC Physics Conference and this support will enable young U.S. scientists to present their own research in an international setting. It will also allow them to exchange ideas on the latest research directions at the Large Hadron Collider.</AbstractNarration>
