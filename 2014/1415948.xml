    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is far-reaching, as successful demonstration of a TEC-SOFC generator will significantly benefit numerous civilian and military sectors, and also encourage further scientific research into this innovative power generation method. The aging U.S. electrical grid, which lacks sufficient redundancy and can leave the country susceptible to cascading blackouts, provides clear motivation for pursuing efficient, safe, and reliable power generation schemes. A TEC-SOFC generator could serve as an onsite generator for residential or industrial applications, eliminating consumer dependency on the current U.S. electrical grid. When fueled by natural gas, preliminary estimates indicate power production at 1/20th the cost of purchasing from the grid, while producing significantly less greenhouse gas emission than current fossil-fuel based approaches. Additionally, this portable technology would immediately benefit the military as a tactical electric generator due to its greatly improved fuel efficiency over existing generator designs. Calculations suggest that widespread adoption of TEC-SOFC generators by the military could reduce fuel-associated costs by 60%. Beneficial scientific impacts from this research are expected to include a more detailed understanding of the thermionic emission performance from advanced cathode materials, so that a range of practical TEC devices can be scientifically realized and commercialized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel, highly efficient power generation technology particularly suited for small-scale, mobile, and off-grid type applications. This proprietary technology involves the combination of thermionic energy conversion (TEC) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)?two highly efficient technologies?to create a generator with prospects of: 1) Greatly improved fuel efficiency, 2) Reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and 3) Cheaper operating costs. Because the resulting TEC-SOFC generator is based on well-established physical and engineering principles, we anticipate rapid product development (&lt;five years). Research to be conducted during this Phase I SBIR project is meant to prove the feasibility of low temperature (&lt;1000oC) TEC devices that utilize advanced electrode materials while also advancing already promising preliminary results. Specific tasks will aim to characterize various electrode compositions and configurations, which will then be implemented into a ?pre-prototype.? Upon completion of Phase I, TEC power output levels in excess of 0.1mW/cm2 at temperatures below 1000oC are anticipated. Power output levels are expected to continually increase up to 5 W/cm2 by the end of Phase II, at which time the development, testing, and commercialization of the full TEC-SOFC generator will commence.</AbstractNarration>
