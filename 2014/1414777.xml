    <AbstractNarration>The potential impacts of climate induced sea level rise on coastal societies are a pressing global issue. The best way to understand sea level responses to climate change is to observe how the processes have proceeded in the past. This research aims to produce and combine high-resolution climate and sea level records so that an interpretation of how the sea level response to climate variation has operated during Late Pleistocene time. The two records will produce direct information on how sea level rose and fell in response to the growth and decay of the major northern hemisphere ice sheets in the Mediterranean. Under the supervision of Dr. Chuan-Chou Shen, this project will be conducted at the National University of Taiwan. Dr. Shen is responsible for the refined analytical precision of mass spectrometric dating methods that will allow for radiometric ages with minimal error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbonate encrustations (CE) are documented above, below, and at the current Mediterranean sea level and stalagmites from the same caves can be accurately dated using U-series methodology, thus precisely constraining the elevation of each sea-level stand and a climate history for the region. Speleothems are sensitive to climate changes as their growth mechanism is linked to Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere. Oxygen and carbon isotopic variations along the growth axis of a given speleothem deposited under isotopic equilibrium conditions are potentially powerful tracers of climatic changes. Dating of fifteen CE and two stalagmites previously collected from Mallorca by means of Multi Collector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer will be used to generate ages. The high resolution U/Th chronology of the two stalagmites and the precisely dated CE will provide timelines for past sea level high and low stands and climate variability. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>
