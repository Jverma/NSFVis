    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for US researchers who will attend the "Workshop on Algebraic Design Theory and Hadamard Matrices," to be held at University of Lethbridge, Canada, during July 8-11, 2014. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers and students interested in the theory of Hadamard matrices and their applications, as well as related areas such as combinatorial design theory, coding theory, quantum information theory and computer security. The participants will learn about the latest developments in these areas, and explore different visions for setting directions for future work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hadamard matrices are indispensable in engineering applications related to mobile communications, data transmission, and error-control codes. In 1893, the great French mathematician Jacques Hadamard posed a problem, which later became known as the Hadamard matrix conjecture, namely, that every positive integer divisible by 4 is the order of a square matrix with entries plus or minus one, and having pairwise orthogonal rows. Although many infinite classes of such matrices are known and a rich theory has evolved, this problem remains unresolved and has risen in the field of combinatorics to a status comparable to that held until recently by Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory.</AbstractNarration>
