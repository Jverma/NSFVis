    <AbstractNarration>The Doppler radial velocity technique is a method of detecting planets outside of our solar system by measuring the slight wobble imparted on the host star by the planet or planets that orbit it. It is one of the most powerful and promising methods of exoplanet detection. Inferring the presence of a planet using this technique, however, requires a very precise measurement of the star's radial velocity. Improvements in the precision of radial velocity measurements will lead to the detection of lower-mass planets, which are currently underrepresented in the sample of known exoplanets. Detecting Earth-like exoplanets is a critical step in the search for life outside of our solar system. In collaboration with Professor Motohide Tamura, at the National Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), this project goal is measuring precise radial velocities of low-mass stars for exoplanet detection and characterization. The NAOJ operates the Subaru Telescope, which will house the Infrared Doppler Instrument (IRD), a state-of-the-art instrument designed to take high-resolution spectra of low-mass stars. The IRD spectra will reveal a whole new population of Earth-like planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another aim of this research project is the development of software designed to measure radial velocities using telluric (atmospheric) absorption lines as a wavelength reference. This method of wavelength calibration is complementary to that employed by the IRD. This study aims to improve the efficacy of both methods. In addition, the telluric line software will be applicable to any ground-based spectrograph that operates in the infrared or near infrared. In particular, the software could be used to improve the precision of several new high-resolution instruments, which will see first light in the next few years. The combination of high-resolution spectrographs and accurate wavelength references in the infrared will result in the discovery of a whole new population of Earth-like exoplanets in the next several years. Further study of this population will advance our understanding of planet formation, the origins of life in the universe, and other such long-standing mysteries. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
