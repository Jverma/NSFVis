    <AbstractNarration>This workshop brings together leading international researchers from Japan, United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom to discuss the stable and secure supply of energy as we head towards a low carbon society that is essential for sustainable development. The objective of the workshop is to discuss our collective research approaches and then develop collaborative efforts to formulate cooperative distributed energy management systems. The workshop will be held at the Hilton Waikiki Beach Hotel in Honolulu, HI on January 11-12, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pressing need around the world to change paradigms of how we both generate and use energy as we move to a more sustainable society considering solutions that require engineering, computational, environmental, policy, economic, and social science research and education. This proposal along with the support of the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency brings together a group of international researchers and educators in energy and sustainability to discuss these issues. The workshop will study a cooperative distributed energy management system that makes optimal control of energy generation and demand response.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is unique as it will bring in distinguished US researchers to participate with Japanese researchers invited by JST along with researchers from Germany and the United Kingdom to discuss and form collaborations on cooperative distributive energy management systems. Topics of discussion include: renewable energy generation including solar and wind along with distributed generation and integration of renewable energy sources; communications, control, and computational aspects of the smart grid; storage options; demand response including load controls, demand side management, price controls, and consumer participation; and smart grid and smart community demonstration projects.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring in researchers from different countries to give different perspectives on developing a cooperative distributed energy management system. This will lead to multinational collaborative research and education efforts. This can lead to novel approaches to tackle energy and sustainability problems and also innovation and commercialization opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
