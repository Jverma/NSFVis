    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project contributes to theories of rights mobilization and claims making through consideration of how local political and civic context shapes rights mobilization and implementation. Research is based on in-depth interviews with federal, state and local government officials, representatives of advocacy groups and other civil society organizations, and persons making labor rights claims to ascertain how variation in political and civic context affects legal consciousness, willingness to mobilize around rights claims, implementation strategies, and government accountability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several broader impacts will result from this research. First, research findings will inform debates over how best to implement federal rights initiatives that seek to improve educational and occupational mobility as well as civic engagement. Second, this research will inform the work of various community organizations and government institutions responding to rights claims and their implementation. Finally, this project will inform course development and research training of graduate students in two public universities.</AbstractNarration>
