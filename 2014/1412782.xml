    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of 18 US participants, especially young researchers and graduate students, to participate in the conference "Beyond Hamilton-Jacobi in Avignon", which will take place in Avignon University, from Wednesday April 23 - 30, 2014. The PIs expect that about 2/3 of the budget will go towards the support of graduate students and postdocs, with recruiting as many underrepresented groups as possible a priority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Avignon conference will cover recent developments in the areas of Weak KAM theory and Aubry-Mather theory. This is a very active area, with origins in practical applications to solid state physics and dynamics. The Avignon conference will bring together participants from many parts of the world to enrich and connect the many different aspects of Weak KAM theory. The junior researchers from the US will be exposed to a high level program and will become acquainted with the most promising and vibrant areas of research connecting PDEs to dynamics. There will be 6 senior lecturers, including the two PIs who are also co-organizers of the event.</AbstractNarration>
