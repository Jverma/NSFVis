    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The Polar Research Board (PRB) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences serves as the U.S. National Committee to two international organizations: the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). IASC encourages and facilitates cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research and in all areas of the Arctic region, provides scientific input to the Arctic Council and other international policy organizations, and provides seed money to support international science development. SCAR helps lead the international Antarctic science community by implementing new research initiatives, identifying emerging scientific themes, promoting international cooperation and partnerships, and providing scientific advice to the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty and others on issues related to the management and protection of the Antarctic region and the Southern Ocean. The U.S. dues requested leverages in-kind contributions from countries around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;U.S. support for IASC and SCAR provides opportunities for U.S. scientists to network and develop partnerships with colleagues in other countries. For early career scientists these organizations offer a forum to expand research interests and make new connections. SCAR and IASC?s policy advisory activities help ensure that important policy decisions about managing and protecting these regions are based, at least in part, on sound scientific assessment. International collaboration through SCAR and IASC ?s interdisciplinary, international research activities allows the U.S. to accomplish scientific objectives that would be impossible for single investigators, programs, or countries to do alone and provides opportunities for U.S. scientists that would not otherwise be available.</AbstractNarration>
