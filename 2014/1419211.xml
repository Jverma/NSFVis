    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;As the US becomes ever more diverse, it becomes increasingly important that each field of science becomes more diverse. Physics, broadly defined, not only lags behind other academic fields in its present level of diversity, but ranks among the least diverse of the scientific or engineering disciplines. This award provides support for 246 students to attend the Annual Conference of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) in the 2014-2015 fiscal years at a location to be determined. The principal goal of this meeting is to increase the number of minority students (African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans) that receive degrees in physics and to provide mentoring for physicists at all stages of their careers. The award is to the Associated Universities Inc. (AUI) which provides its expertise and staff to manage the grant and work with the NSBP in organizing the meeting and the NSBP brings recognized experience of hosting past conferences. The NSBP Annual Conference is a scientific meeting that serves as an opportunity to discuss cutting-edge science, to disseminate new results, and to spark the exchange of ideas among students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty. Through Conference discussions and seminars that include students, faculty, professionals, and recruiters, it is possible to learn more about the views and desires of minority physicists. These insights are valuable to those who are working to increasing diversity in physics. Abstracts for talks and posters are accepted from a wide range of physics sub-fields including condensed matter, nuclear, astrophysics and others. The NSBP Conference has an open abstract process for contributed talks just like any other conference with invited and plenary speakers, as well as published proceedings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;As the US becomes ever more diverse, it becomes increasingly important that each field of science becomes more diverse.
