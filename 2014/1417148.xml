    <AbstractNarration>This research team builds and studies models of the earth's core with a focus on generating magnetic fields. The research team uses a twenty-ton, rapidly rotating model of the Earth's core to examine questions about the turbulence within the core and observed changes in the Earth's field. Despite the known central importance of the Earth's magnetic field in limiting dangerous radiation from the sun, we do not now have the ability to predict changes in the field. The data the PI and his team will collect will be used in a way that will allow building predictive tools. The project also serves to educate a new generation of scholars in geophysics experiments, including undergraduate mentoring and graduate student training. As well, the public appreciation of science is a critical component of ensuring our nation's strength in science and technology. In support of public appreciation of science the research team offers lab tours to a very broad range of audiences: middle school girls (annual), high school groups, undergraduate clubs, prospective undergraduate and graduate students, visiting faculty, visiting families of faculty and staff, visiting government staff, and science journalists. In addition the team offers short pedagogical videos, posted on the research group YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/user/n3umh).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this research is to use laboratory experiments to better understand the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field. The research team uses a twenty-ton, rapidly rotating model of the Earth's core to examine the generation of magnetic fields in a planetary context. There are many unknowns in the earth due to the turbulent dynamics present, and due to our limited understanding of those dynamics. Despite the known central importance of the Earth's magnetic field in limiting dangerous radiation from the sun, that field changes dynamically in a way that we cannot, for now, forecast. The PI team has developed a world-unique experimental device to model our planetary core, which allows them to explore how rapidly rotating turbulent flows induce magnetic fields. The parameter values to be explored have not been studied previously, as the device is built to run at exceptional magnetic Reynolds numbers, designed to match those of the Earth. The data they will collect can be used in a way that will allow challenges to numerical theory predictions. Understanding the dynamics and prediction limits for the geomagnetic field are central goals for this experimental project.</AbstractNarration>
