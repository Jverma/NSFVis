    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development of a new radiation detection technology with the potential to increase global nuclear detection coverage by at least an order of magnitude, while meeting important non-proliferation and homeland security budget constraints. Current radiation detection technology is too expensive to be deployed in large, discreet networks that cover global transportation pathways, cities, and nuclear storage sites. This project will develop a new product which combines a proven detector geometry (flat-panel multi-wire proportional chamber) with a powerful neutron conversion material (enriched lithium metal). By adopting expertise from the window industry, this project will substantially reduce the cost of these detectors via the development and demonstration of innovative panel sealing protocols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this effort is to design and test a flat-panel gas chamber body that adapts the hermetic sealing technologies used in electronics and vacuum insulated glass (VIG) windows. This sealing technology allows sensors to function in harsh environments: under water, in zero gravity, and in deep space applications. The Phase I work covers three approaches for lower-cost, high manufacturability chamber sealing mechanisms that will be optimal for smaller, robust chambers used in secondary markets (academic research, steel reprocessing, oil/gas industry). These sealing methods include ultrasonic soldering using flux-free solders, electrical resistance welding, and laser welding. Adaptation of this technology to neutron detectors will increase the robustness and reduce the manufacturing costs of the chambers. The expected outcomes will include proving out a cost-effective process to hermetically seal next generation gas chambers while maintaining high detector performance and durability.</AbstractNarration>
